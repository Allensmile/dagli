Anonymized FastText is a fork of JavaFastText, itself a Java port of FastText.  Anonymized FastText implements a number
of improvements over the original implementation, including hashing of tokens (hence the name, but please note that
hashing does not prevent any information recovery; e.g. it is easy to test if a token was seen during training by
hashing it and checking for that hash, but it is much harder to determine what the tokens were de novo).
