Character	Dialog
ANTONIUS	Cæsar, my lord.
ANTONIUS	I shall remember:
ANTONIUS	When Cæsar says 'Do this,' it is perform'd.
ANTONIUS	Cæsar.
ANTONIUS	Fear him not, Cæsar, he's not dangerous;
ANTONIUS	He is a noble Roman, and well given.
ANTONIUS	So to most noble Cæsar.
ANTONIUS	O mighty Cæsar! dost thou lie so low?
ANTONIUS	Are all thy conquests, glories, triumphs, spoils,
ANTONIUS	Shrunk to this little measure? Fare thee well.
ANTONIUS	I know not, gentlemen, what you intend,
ANTONIUS	Who else must be let blood, who else is rank:
ANTONIUS	If I myself, there is no hour so fit
ANTONIUS	As Cæsar's death's hour, nor no instrument
ANTONIUS	Of half that worth as those your swords, made rich
ANTONIUS	With the most noble blood of all this world.
ANTONIUS	I do beseech ye, if ye bear me hard,
ANTONIUS	Now, whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke,
ANTONIUS	Fulfil your pleasure. Live a thousand years,
ANTONIUS	I shall not find myself so apt to die:
ANTONIUS	No place will please me so, no mean of death,
ANTONIUS	As here by Cæsar, and by you cut off,
ANTONIUS	The choice and master spirits of this age.
ANTONIUS	I doubt not of your wisdom.
ANTONIUS	Let each man render me his bloody hand:
ANTONIUS	First, Marcus Brutus, will I shake with you;
ANTONIUS	Next, Caius Cassius, do I take your hand;
ANTONIUS	Now, Decius Brutus, yours; now yours, Metellus;
ANTONIUS	Yours, Cinna; and, my valiant Casca, yours;
ANTONIUS	Though last, not least in love, yours, good Trebonius.
ANTONIUS	Gentlemen all,—alas! what shall I say?
ANTONIUS	My credit now stands on such slippery ground,
ANTONIUS	That one of two bad ways you must conceit me,
ANTONIUS	Either a coward or a flatterer.
ANTONIUS	That I did love thee, Cæsar, O! 'tis true:
ANTONIUS	If then thy spirit look upon us now,
ANTONIUS	Shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death,
ANTONIUS	To see thy Antony making his peace,
ANTONIUS	Shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes,
ANTONIUS	Most noble! in the presence of thy corse?
ANTONIUS	Had I as many eyes as thou hast wounds,
ANTONIUS	Weeping as fast as they com.linkedin.dagli.util.stream forth thy blood,
ANTONIUS	It would become me better than to close
ANTONIUS	In terms of friendship with thine enemies.
ANTONIUS	Pardon me, Julius! Here wast thou bay'd, brave hart;
ANTONIUS	Here didst thou fall; and here thy hunters stand,
ANTONIUS	Sign'd in thy spoil, and crimson'd in thy leth
ANTONIUS	O world! thou wast the forest to this hart;
ANTONIUS	And this, indeed, O world! the heart of thee.
ANTONIUS	How like a deer, strucken by many princes,
ANTONIUS	Dost thou here lie!
ANTONIUS	Pardon me, Caius Cassius:
ANTONIUS	The enemies of Cæsar shall say this;
ANTONIUS	Then, in a friend, it is cold modesty.
ANTONIUS	Therefore I took your hands, but was indeed
ANTONIUS	Sway'd from the point by looking down on Cæsar.
ANTONIUS	Friends am I with you all, and love you all,
ANTONIUS	Upon this hope, that you shall give me reasons
ANTONIUS	Why and wherein Cæsar was dangerous.
ANTONIUS	That's all I seek:
ANTONIUS	And am moreover suitor that I may
ANTONIUS	Produce his body to the market place;
ANTONIUS	And in the pulpit, as becomes a friend,
ANTONIUS	Speak in the order of his funeral.
ANTONIUS	Be it so;
ANTONIUS	I do desire no more.
ANTONIUS	O! pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth,
ANTONIUS	That I am meek and gentle with these butchers;
ANTONIUS	Thou art the ruins of the noblest man
ANTONIUS	That ever lived in the tide of times.
ANTONIUS	Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood!
ANTONIUS	Over thy wounds now do I prophesy,
ANTONIUS	Which like dumb mouths do ope their ruby lips,
ANTONIUS	To beg the voice and utterance of my tongue,
ANTONIUS	A curse shall light upon the limbs of men;
ANTONIUS	Domestic fury and fierce civil strife
ANTONIUS	Shall cumber all the parts of Italy;
ANTONIUS	Blood and destruction shall be so in use,
ANTONIUS	And dreadful objects so familiar,
ANTONIUS	That mothers shall but smile when they behold
ANTONIUS	Their infants quarter'd with the hands of war;
ANTONIUS	All pity chok'd with custom of fell deeds:
ANTONIUS	And Cæsar's spirit, ranging for revenge,
ANTONIUS	With Ate by his side come hot from hell,
ANTONIUS	Shall in these confines with a monarch's voice
ANTONIUS	Cry 'Havoc!' and let slip the dogs of war;
ANTONIUS	That this foul deed shall smell above the earth
ANTONIUS	With carrion men, groaning for burial.
ANTONIUS	You serve Octavius Cæsar, do you not?
ANTONIUS	Cæsar did write for him to come to Rome.
ANTONIUS	Thy heart is big, get thee apart and weep.
ANTONIUS	Passion, I see, is catching; for mine eyes,
ANTONIUS	Seeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine,
ANTONIUS	Began to water. Is thy master coming?
ANTONIUS	Post back with speed, and tell him what hath chanc'd:
ANTONIUS	Hare is a mourning Rome, a dangerous Rome,
ANTONIUS	No Rome of safety for Octavius yet;
ANTONIUS	Hie hence and tell him so. Yet, stay awhile;
ANTONIUS	Thou shalt not back till I have borne this corpse
ANTONIUS	Into the market-place; there shall I try,
ANTONIUS	In my oration, how the people take
ANTONIUS	The cruel issue of these bloody men;
ANTONIUS	According to the which thou shalt discourse
ANTONIUS	To young Octavius of the state of things.
ANTONIUS	Lead me your hand.
ANTONIUS	For Brutus' sake, I am beholding to you.
ANTONIUS	You gentle Romans,—
ANTONIUS	Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears;
ANTONIUS	I come to bury Cæsar, not to praise him.
ANTONIUS	The evil that men do lives after them,
ANTONIUS	The good is oft interred with their bones;
ANTONIUS	So let it be with Cæsar. The noble Brutus
ANTONIUS	Hath told you Cæsar was ambitious;
ANTONIUS	If it were so, it was a grievous fault,
ANTONIUS	And grievously hath Cæsar answer'd it.
ANTONIUS	Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest,—
ANTONIUS	For Brutus is an honourable man;
ANTONIUS	So are they all, all honourable men,—
ANTONIUS	Come I to speak in Cæsar's funeral.
ANTONIUS	He was my friend, faithful and just to me:
ANTONIUS	But Brutus says he was ambitious;
ANTONIUS	And Brutus is an honourable man.
ANTONIUS	He hath brought many captives home to Rome,
ANTONIUS	Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill:
ANTONIUS	Did this in Cæsar seem ambitious?
ANTONIUS	When that the poor have cried, Cæsar hath wept;
ANTONIUS	Ambition should be made of sterner stuff:
ANTONIUS	Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;
ANTONIUS	And Brutus is an honourable man.
ANTONIUS	You all did see that on the Lupercal
ANTONIUS	I thrice presented him a kingly crown,
ANTONIUS	Which he did thrice refuse: was this ambition?
ANTONIUS	Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;
ANTONIUS	And, sure, he is an honourable man.
ANTONIUS	I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,
ANTONIUS	But here I am to speak what I do know,
ANTONIUS	You all did love him once, not without cause:
ANTONIUS	What cause withholds you then to mourn for him?
ANTONIUS	O judgment! thou art fled to brutish beasts,
ANTONIUS	And men have lost their reason. Bear with me;
ANTONIUS	My heart is in the coffin there with Cæsar,
ANTONIUS	And I must pause till it come back to me.
ANTONIUS	But yesterday the word of Cæsar might
ANTONIUS	Have stood against the world; now lies he there,
ANTONIUS	And none so poor to do him reverence.
ANTONIUS	O masters! if I were dispos'd to stir
ANTONIUS	Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage,
ANTONIUS	I should do Brutus wrong, and Cassius wrong,
ANTONIUS	Who, you all know, are honourable men.
ANTONIUS	I will not do them wrong; I rather choose
ANTONIUS	To wrong the dead, to wrong myself, and you,
ANTONIUS	Than I will wrong such honourable men
ANTONIUS	But here's a parchment with the seal of Cæsar;
ANTONIUS	I found it in his closet, 'tis his will.
ANTONIUS	Let but the commons hear this testament—
ANTONIUS	Which, pardon me, I do not mean to read—
ANTONIUS	And they would go and kiss dead Cæsar's wounds,
ANTONIUS	And dip their napkins in his sacred blood,
ANTONIUS	Yea, beg a hair of him for memory,
ANTONIUS	And, dying, mention it within their wills,
ANTONIUS	Bequeathing it as a rich legacy
ANTONIUS	Unto their issue.
ANTONIUS	Have patience, gentle friends; I must not read it:
ANTONIUS	It is not meet you know how Cæsar lov'd you.
ANTONIUS	You are not wood, you are not stones, but men;
ANTONIUS	And, being men, hearing the will of Cæsar,
ANTONIUS	It will inflame you, it will make you mad.
ANTONIUS	'Tis good you know not that you are his heirs;
ANTONIUS	For if you should, O! what would come of it.
ANTONIUS	Will you be patient? Will you stay awhile?
ANTONIUS	I have o'ershot myself to tell you of it.
ANTONIUS	I fear I wrong the honourable men
ANTONIUS	Whose daggers have stabb'd Cæsar; I do fear it.
ANTONIUS	You will compel me then to read the will?
ANTONIUS	Then make a ring about the corpse of Cæsar,
ANTONIUS	And let me show you him that made the will.
ANTONIUS	Shall I descend? and will you give me leave?
ANTONIUS	Nay, press not so upon me; stand far off.
ANTONIUS	If you have tears, prepare to shed them now.
ANTONIUS	You all do know this mantle: I remember
ANTONIUS	The first time ever Cæsar put it on;
ANTONIUS	'Twas on a summer's evening, in his tent,
ANTONIUS	That day he overcame the Nervii.
ANTONIUS	Look! in this place ran Cassius' dagger through:
ANTONIUS	See what a rent the envious Casca made:
ANTONIUS	Through this the well-beloved Brutus stabb'd;
ANTONIUS	And, as he pluck'd his cursed steel away,
ANTONIUS	Mark how the blood of Cæsar follow'd it,
ANTONIUS	As rushing out of doors, to be resolv'd
ANTONIUS	If Brutus so unkindly knock'd or no;
ANTONIUS	For Brutus, as you know, was Cæsar's angel:
ANTONIUS	Judge, O you gods! how dearly Cæsar lov'd him.
ANTONIUS	This was the most unkindest cut of all;
ANTONIUS	For when the noble Cæsar saw him stab,
ANTONIUS	Ingratitude, more strong than traitors' arms,
ANTONIUS	Quite vanquish'd him: then burst his mighty heart;
ANTONIUS	And, in his mantle muffling up his face,
ANTONIUS	Even at the base of Pompey's status,
ANTONIUS	Which all the while ran blood, great Cæsar fell.
ANTONIUS	O! what a fall was there, my countrymen;
ANTONIUS	Then I, and you, and all of us fell down,
ANTONIUS	Whilst bloody treason flourish'd over us.
ANTONIUS	O! now you weep, and I perceive you feel
ANTONIUS	The dint of pity; these are gracious drops.
ANTONIUS	Kind souls, what! weep you when you but behold
ANTONIUS	Our Cæsar's vesture wounded? Look you here,
ANTONIUS	Here is himself, marr'd, as you see, with traitors.
ANTONIUS	Stay, countrymen!
ANTONIUS	Good friends, sweet friends, let me not stir you up
ANTONIUS	To such a sudden flood of mutiny.
ANTONIUS	They that have done this deed are honourable:
ANTONIUS	What private griefs they have, alas! I know not,
ANTONIUS	That made them do it; they are wise and honourable,
ANTONIUS	And will, no doubt, with reasons answer you.
ANTONIUS	I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts:
ANTONIUS	I am no orator, as Brutus is;
ANTONIUS	But, as you know me all, a plain blunt man,
ANTONIUS	That love my friend; and that they know full well
ANTONIUS	That gave me public leave to speak of him.
ANTONIUS	For I have neither wit, nor words, nor worth,
ANTONIUS	Action, nor utterance, nor the power of speech,
ANTONIUS	To stir men's blood: I only speak right on;
ANTONIUS	I tell you that which you yourselves do know,
ANTONIUS	Show you sweet Cæsar's wounds, poor poor dumb mouths,
ANTONIUS	And bid them speak for me: but were I Brutus,
ANTONIUS	And Brutus Antony, there were an Antony
ANTONIUS	Would ruffle up your spirits, and put a tongue
ANTONIUS	In every wound of Cæsar, that should move
ANTONIUS	The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny.
ANTONIUS	Yet hear me, countrymen; yet hear me speak.
ANTONIUS	Why, friends, you go to do you know not what.
ANTONIUS	Wherein hath Cæsar thus deserv'd your loves?
ANTONIUS	Alas! you know not: I must tell you then.
ANTONIUS	You have forgot the will I told you of.
ANTONIUS	Here is the will, and under Cæsar's seal.
ANTONIUS	To every Roman citizen he gives,
ANTONIUS	To every several man, seventy-five drachmas.
ANTONIUS	Hear me with patience.
ANTONIUS	Moreover, he hath left you all his walks,
ANTONIUS	His private arbours, and new-planted orchards,
ANTONIUS	On this side Tiber; he hath left them you,
ANTONIUS	And to your heirs for ever; common pleasures,
ANTONIUS	To walk abroad, and recreate yourselves.
ANTONIUS	Here was a Cæsar! when comes such another?
ANTONIUS	Now let it work: mischief, thou art afoot,
ANTONIUS	Take thou what course thou wilt!
ANTONIUS	How now, fellow!
ANTONIUS	Where is he?
ANTONIUS	And thither will I straight to visit him.
ANTONIUS	He comes upon a wish. Fortune is merry,
ANTONIUS	And in this mood will give us any thing.
ANTONIUS	Belike they had some notice of the people,
ANTONIUS	How I had mov'd them. Bring me to Octavius.
ANTONIUS	These many then shall die; their names are prick'd.
ANTONIUS	He shall not live; look, with a spot I damn him.
ANTONIUS	But, Lepidus, go you to Cæsar's house;
ANTONIUS	Fetch the will hither, and we shall determine
ANTONIUS	How to cut off some charge in legacies.
ANTONIUS	This is a slight unmeritable man,
ANTONIUS	Meet to be sent on errands: is it fit,
ANTONIUS	The three-fold world divided, he should stand
ANTONIUS	One of the three to share it?
ANTONIUS	Octavius, I have seen more days than you:
ANTONIUS	And though we lay these honours on this man,
ANTONIUS	To ease ourselves of divers slanderous loads,
ANTONIUS	He shall but bear them as the ass bears gold,
ANTONIUS	To groan and sweat under the business,
ANTONIUS	Either led or driven, as we point the way;
ANTONIUS	And having brought our treasure where we will,
ANTONIUS	Then take we down his load, and turn him off,
ANTONIUS	Like to the empty ass, to shake his ears,
ANTONIUS	And graze in commons.
ANTONIUS	So is my horse, Octavius; and for that
ANTONIUS	I do appoint him store of provender.
ANTONIUS	It is a creature that I teach to fight,
ANTONIUS	To wind, to stop, to run directly on,
ANTONIUS	His corporal motion govern'd by my spirit.
ANTONIUS	And, in some taste, is Lepidus but so;
ANTONIUS	He must be taught, and train'd, and bid go forth;
ANTONIUS	A barren-spirited fellow; one that feeds
ANTONIUS	On abject orts, and imitations,
ANTONIUS	Which, out of use and stal'd by other men,
ANTONIUS	Begin his fashion: do not talk of him
ANTONIUS	But as a property. And now, Octavius,
ANTONIUS	Listen great things: Brutus and Cassius
ANTONIUS	Are levying powers; we must straight make head;
ANTONIUS	Therefore let our alliance be combin'd,
ANTONIUS	Our best friends made, and our best means stretch'd out;
ANTONIUS	And let us presently go sit in council,
ANTONIUS	How covert matters may be best disclos'd,
ANTONIUS	And open perils surest answered.
ANTONIUS	Tut! I am in their bosoms, and I know
ANTONIUS	Wherefore they do it: they could be content
ANTONIUS	To visit other places; and come down
ANTONIUS	With fearful bravery, thinking by this face
ANTONIUS	To fasten in our thoughts that they have courage;
ANTONIUS	But 'tis not so.
ANTONIUS	Octavius, lead your battle softly on,
ANTONIUS	Upon the left hand of the even field.
ANTONIUS	Why do you cross me in this exigent?
ANTONIUS	No, Cæsar, we will answer on their charge.
ANTONIUS	Make forth; the generals would have some words.
ANTONIUS	In your bad strokes, Brutus, you give good words:
ANTONIUS	Witness the hole you made in Cæsar's heart,
ANTONIUS	Crying, 'Long live! hail, Cæsar!'
ANTONIUS	Not stingless too.
ANTONIUS	Villains! you did not so when your vile daggers
ANTONIUS	Hack'd one another in the sides of Cæsar:
ANTONIUS	How show'd your teeth like apes, and fawn'd like hounds,
ANTONIUS	And bow'd like bondmen, kissing Cæsar's feet;
ANTONIUS	Whilst damned Casca, like a cur, behind
ANTONIUS	Struck Cæsar on the neck. O you flatterers!
ANTONIUS	Old Cassius still!
ANTONIUS	Where is he?
ANTONIUS	This is not Brutus, friend; but, I assure you,
ANTONIUS	A prize no less in worth. Keep this man safe,
ANTONIUS	Give him all kindness: I had rather have
ANTONIUS	Such men my friends than enemies. Go on,
ANTONIUS	And see whe'r Brutus be alive or dead;
ANTONIUS	And bring us word unto Octavius' tent,
ANTONIUS	How every thing is chanc'd.
ANTONIUS	This was the noblest Roman of them all;
ANTONIUS	All the conspirators save only he
ANTONIUS	Did that they did in envy of great Cæsar;
ANTONIUS	He only, in a general honest thought
ANTONIUS	And common good to all, made one of them.
ANTONIUS	His life was gentle, and the elements
ANTONIUS	So mix'd in him that Nature might stand up
ANTONIUS	And say to all the world, 'This was a man!'
BANQUO	How far is 't call'd to Forres? What are these,
BANQUO	So wither'd and so wild in their attire,
BANQUO	That look not like th' inhabitants o' the earth,
BANQUO	And yet are on 't? Live you? or are you aught
BANQUO	That man may question? You seem to understand me,
BANQUO	By each at once her choppy finger laying
BANQUO	Upon her skinny lips: you should be women,
BANQUO	And yet your beards forbid me to interpret
BANQUO	That you are so.
BANQUO	Good sir, why do you start, and seem to fear
BANQUO	Things that do sound so fair? I' the name of truth,
BANQUO	Are ye fantastical, or that indeed
BANQUO	Which outwardly ye show? My noble partner
BANQUO	You greet with present grace and great prediction
BANQUO	Of noble having and of royal hope,
BANQUO	That he seems rapt withal: to me you speak not.
BANQUO	If you can look into the seeds of time,
BANQUO	And say which grain will grow and which will not,
BANQUO	Speak then to me, who neither beg nor fear
BANQUO	Your favours nor your hate.
BANQUO	The earth hath bubbles, as the water has,
BANQUO	And these are of them. Whither are they vanish'd?
BANQUO	Were such things here as we do speak about?
BANQUO	Or have we eaten on the insane root
BANQUO	That takes the reason prisoner?
BANQUO	You shall be king.
BANQUO	To the self-same tune and words. Who's here?
BANQUO	What! can the devil speak true?
BANQUO	That, trusted home,
BANQUO	Might yet enkindle you unto the crown,
BANQUO	Besides the Thane of Cawdor. But 'tis strange:
BANQUO	And oftentimes, to win us to our harm,
BANQUO	The instruments of darkness tell us truths,
BANQUO	Win us with honest trifles, to betray's
BANQUO	In deepest consequence.
BANQUO	Cousins, a word, I pray you.
BANQUO	Look, how our partner's rapt.
BANQUO	New honours come upon him,
BANQUO	Like our strange garments, cleave not to their mould
BANQUO	But with the aid of use.
BANQUO	Worthy Macbeth, we stay upon your leisure.
BANQUO	Very gladly.
BANQUO	There if I grow,
BANQUO	The harvest is your own.
BANQUO	This guest of summer,
BANQUO	The temple-haunting martlet, does approve
BANQUO	By his lov'd mansionry that the heaven's breath
BANQUO	Smells wooingly here: no jutty, frieze,
BANQUO	Buttress, nor coign of vantage, but this bird
BANQUO	Hath made his pendent bed and procreant cradle:
BANQUO	Where they most breed and haunt, I have observ'd
BANQUO	The air is delicate.
BANQUO	How goes the night, boy?
BANQUO	And she goes down at twelve.
BANQUO	Hold, take my sword. There's husbandry in heaven;
BANQUO	Their candles are all out. Take thee that too.
BANQUO	A heavy summons lies like lead upon me,
BANQUO	And yet I would not sleep: merciful powers!
BANQUO	Restrain in me the cursed thoughts that nature
BANQUO	Gives way to in repose.
BANQUO	Give me my sword.—
BANQUO	Who's there?
BANQUO	What, sir! not yet at rest? The king's a-bed:
BANQUO	He hath been in unusual pleasure, and
BANQUO	Sent forth great largess to your offices.
BANQUO	This diamond he greets your wife withal,
BANQUO	By the name of most kind hostess; and shut up
BANQUO	In measureless content.
BANQUO	All's well.
BANQUO	I dreamt last night of the three weird sisters:
BANQUO	To you they have show'd some truth.
BANQUO	At your kind'st leisure.
BANQUO	So I lose none
BANQUO	In seeking to augment it, but still keep
BANQUO	My bosom franchis'd and allegiance clear,
BANQUO	I shall be counsell'd.
BANQUO	Thanks, sir: the like to you.
BANQUO	Too cruel any where.
BANQUO	Dear Duff, I prithee, contradict thyself,
BANQUO	And say it is not so.
BANQUO	Look to the lady:
BANQUO	And when we have our naked frailties hid,
BANQUO	That suffer in exposure, let us meet,
BANQUO	And question this most bloody piece of work,
BANQUO	To know it further. Fears and scruples shake us:
BANQUO	In the great hand of God I stand, and thence
BANQUO	Against the undivulg'd pretence I fight
BANQUO	Of treasonous malice.
BANQUO	Thou hast it now: King, Cawdor, Glamis, all,
BANQUO	As the weird women promis'd; and, I fear,
BANQUO	Thou play'dst most foully for 't; yet it was said
BANQUO	It should not stand in thy posterity,
BANQUO	But that myself should be the root and father
BANQUO	Of many kings. If there come truth from them,—
BANQUO	As upon thee, Macbeth, their speeches shine,—
BANQUO	Why, by the verities on thee made good,
BANQUO	May they not be my oracles as well,
BANQUO	And set me up in hope? But, hush! no more.
BANQUO	Let your highness
BANQUO	Command upon me; to the which my duties
BANQUO	Are with a most indissoluble tie
BANQUO	For ever knit.
BANQUO	Ay, my good lord.
BANQUO	As far, my lord, as will fill up the time
BANQUO	'Twixt this and supper; go not my horse the better,
BANQUO	I must become a borrower of the night
BANQUO	For a dark hour or twain.
BANQUO	My lord, I will not.
BANQUO	Ay, my good lord: our time does call upon 's.
BANQUO	Give us a light there, ho!
BANQUO	It will be rain to-night.
BANQUO	O, treachery! Fly, good Fleance, fly, fly, fly!
BANQUO	Thou mayst revenge. O slave!
BENVOLIO	Part, fools!
BENVOLIO	Put up your swords; you know not what you do.
BENVOLIO	I do but keep the peace: put up thy sword,
BENVOLIO	Or manage it to part these men with me.
BENVOLIO	Here were the servants of your adversary
BENVOLIO	And yours close fighting ere I did approach:
BENVOLIO	I drew to part them; in the instant came
BENVOLIO	The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepar'd,
BENVOLIO	Which, as he breath'd defiance to my ears,
BENVOLIO	He swung about his head, and cut the winds,
BENVOLIO	Who, nothing hurt withal hiss'd him in scorn.
BENVOLIO	While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,
BENVOLIO	Came more and more, and fought on part and part,
BENVOLIO	Till the prince came, who parted either part.
BENVOLIO	Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun
BENVOLIO	Peer'd forth the golden window of the east,
BENVOLIO	A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;
BENVOLIO	Where, underneath the grove of sycamore
BENVOLIO	That westward rooteth from the city's side,
BENVOLIO	So early walking did I see your son:
BENVOLIO	Towards him I made; but he was ware of me,
BENVOLIO	And stole into the covert of the wood:
BENVOLIO	I, measuring his affections by my own,
BENVOLIO	That most are busied when they're most alone,
BENVOLIO	Pursu'd my humour not pursuing his,
BENVOLIO	And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.
BENVOLIO	My noble uncle, do you know the cause?
BENVOLIO	Have you importun'd him by any means?
BENVOLIO	See where he comes: so please you, step aside;
BENVOLIO	I'll know his grievance, or be much denied.
BENVOLIO	Good morrow, cousin.
BENVOLIO	But new struck nine.
BENVOLIO	It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
BENVOLIO	In love?
BENVOLIO	Of love?
BENVOLIO	Alas! that love, so gentle in his view,
BENVOLIO	Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof.
BENVOLIO	No, coz, I rather weep.
BENVOLIO	At thy good heart's oppression.
BENVOLIO	Soft, I will go along;
BENVOLIO	An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.
BENVOLIO	Tell me in sadness, who is that you love.
BENVOLIO	Groan! why, no;
BENVOLIO	But sadly tell me who.
BENVOLIO	I aim'd so near when I suppos'd you lov'd.
BENVOLIO	A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.
BENVOLIO	Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
BENVOLIO	Be rul'd by me; forget to think of her.
BENVOLIO	By giving liberty unto thine eyes:
BENVOLIO	Examine other beauties.
BENVOLIO	I'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.
BENVOLIO	Tut! man, one fire burns out another's burning,
BENVOLIO	One pain is lessen'd by another's anguish;
BENVOLIO	Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning;
BENVOLIO	One desperate grief cures with another's languish:
BENVOLIO	Take thou some new infection to thy eye,
BENVOLIO	And the rank poison of the old will die.
BENVOLIO	For what, I pray thee?
BENVOLIO	Why, Romeo, art thou mad?
BENVOLIO	At this same ancient feast of Capulet's,
BENVOLIO	Sups the fair Rosaline, whom thou so lov'st,
BENVOLIO	With all the admired beauties of Verona:
BENVOLIO	Go thither; and, with unattainted eye
BENVOLIO	Compare her face with some that I shall show,
BENVOLIO	And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.
BENVOLIO	Tut! you saw her fair, none else being by,
BENVOLIO	Herself pois'd with herself in either eye;
BENVOLIO	But in that crystal scales let there be weigh'd
BENVOLIO	Your lady's love against some other maid
BENVOLIO	That I will show you shining at this feast,
BENVOLIO	And she shall scant show well that now shows best.
BENVOLIO	The date is out of such prolixity:
BENVOLIO	We'll have no Cupid hood-wink'd with a scarf,
BENVOLIO	Bearing a Tartar's painted bow of lath,
BENVOLIO	Scaring the ladies like a crow-keeper;
BENVOLIO	Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke
BENVOLIO	After the prompter, for our entrance:
BENVOLIO	But, let them measure us by what they will,
BENVOLIO	We'll measure them a measure, and be gone.
BENVOLIO	Come, knock and enter; and no sooner in,
BENVOLIO	But every man betake him to his legs.
BENVOLIO	Queen Mab! What's she?
BENVOLIO	This wind you talk of blows us from ourselves;
BENVOLIO	Supper is done, and we shall come too late.
BENVOLIO	Strike, drum.
BENVOLIO	Away, be gone; the sport is at the best.
BENVOLIO	Romeo! my cousin Romeo!
BENVOLIO	He ran this way, and leap'd this orchard wall:
BENVOLIO	Call, good Mercutio.
BENVOLIO	An if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.
BENVOLIO	Come, he hath hid himself among these trees,
BENVOLIO	To be consorted with the humorous night:
BENVOLIO	Blind is his love and best befits the dark.
BENVOLIO	Go, then; for 'tis in vain
BENVOLIO	To seek him here that means not to be found.
BENVOLIO	Not to his father's; I spoke with his man.
BENVOLIO	Tybalt, the kinsman of old Capulet,
BENVOLIO	Hath sent a letter to his father's house.
BENVOLIO	Romeo will answer it.
BENVOLIO	Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he dares, being dared.
BENVOLIO	Why, what is Tybalt?
BENVOLIO	The what?
BENVOLIO	Here comes Romeo, here comes Romeo.
BENVOLIO	Stop there, stop there.
BENVOLIO	Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.
BENVOLIO	Two, two; a shirt and a smock.
BENVOLIO	She will indite him to some supper.
BENVOLIO	I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's retire:
BENVOLIO	The day is hot, the Capulets abroad,
BENVOLIO	And, if we meet, we shall not 'scape a brawl;
BENVOLIO	For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.
BENVOLIO	Am I like such a fellow?
BENVOLIO	And what to?
BENVOLIO	An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man should buy the fee-simple of my life for an hour and a quarter.
BENVOLIO	By my head, here come the Capulets.
BENVOLIO	We talk here in the public haunt of men:
BENVOLIO	Either withdraw unto some private place,
BENVOLIO	Or reason coldly of your grievances,
BENVOLIO	Or else depart; here all eyes gaze on us.
BENVOLIO	What! art thou hurt?
BENVOLIO	O Romeo, Romeo! brave Mercutio's dead;
BENVOLIO	That gallant spirit hath aspir'd the clouds,
BENVOLIO	Which too untimely here did scorn the earth.
BENVOLIO	Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.
BENVOLIO	Romeo, away! be gone!
BENVOLIO	The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.
BENVOLIO	Stand not amaz'd: the prince will doom thee death
BENVOLIO	If thou art taken: hence! be gone! away!
BENVOLIO	Why dost thou stay?
BENVOLIO	There lies that Tybalt.
BENVOLIO	O noble prince! I can discover all
BENVOLIO	The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl:
BENVOLIO	There lies the man, slain by young Romeo,
BENVOLIO	That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.
BENVOLIO	Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo's hand did slay:
BENVOLIO	Romeo, that spoke him fair, bade him bethink
BENVOLIO	How nice the quarrel was, and urg'd withal
BENVOLIO	Your high displeasure: all this, uttered
BENVOLIO	With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow'd,
BENVOLIO	Could not take truce with the unruly spleen
BENVOLIO	Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts
BENVOLIO	With piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast,
BENVOLIO	Who, all as hot, turns deadly point to point,
BENVOLIO	And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats
BENVOLIO	Cold death aside, and with the other sends
BENVOLIO	It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity
BENVOLIO	Retorts it: Romeo he cries aloud,
BENVOLIO	'Hold, friends! friends, part!' and, swifter than his tongue,
BENVOLIO	His agile arm beats down their fatal points,
BENVOLIO	And 'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm
BENVOLIO	An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life
BENVOLIO	Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled;
BENVOLIO	But by and by comes back to Romeo,
BENVOLIO	Who had but newly entertain'd revenge,
BENVOLIO	And to 't they go like lightning, for, ere I.
BENVOLIO	Could draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain,
BENVOLIO	And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.
BENVOLIO	This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.
BRUTUS	A soothsayer bids you beware the ides of March.
BRUTUS	Not I.
BRUTUS	I am not gamesome: I do lack some part
BRUTUS	Of that quick spirit that is in Antony.
BRUTUS	Let me not hinder, Cassius, your desires;
BRUTUS	I'll leave you.
BRUTUS	Cassius,
BRUTUS	Be not deceiv'd: if I have veil'd my look,
BRUTUS	I turn the trouble of my countenance
BRUTUS	Merely upon myself. Vexed I am
BRUTUS	Of late with passions of some difference,
BRUTUS	Conceptions only proper to myself,
BRUTUS	Which give some soil perhaps to my behaviours;
BRUTUS	But let not therefore my good friends be griev'd,—
BRUTUS	Among which number, Cassius, be you one,—
BRUTUS	Nor construe any further my neglect,
BRUTUS	Than that poor Brutus, with himself at war,
BRUTUS	Forgets the shows of love to other men.
BRUTUS	No, Cassius; for the eye sees not itself,
BRUTUS	But by reflection, by some other things.
BRUTUS	Into what dangers would you lead me, Cassius,
BRUTUS	That you would have me seek into myself
BRUTUS	For that which is not in me?
BRUTUS	What means this shouting? I do fear the people
BRUTUS	Choose Cæsar for their king.
BRUTUS	I would not, Cassius; yet I love him well.
BRUTUS	But wherefore do you hold me here so long?
BRUTUS	What is it that you would impart to me?
BRUTUS	If it be aught toward the general good,
BRUTUS	Set honour in one eye and death i' the other,
BRUTUS	And I will look on both indifferently;
BRUTUS	For let the gods so speed me as I love
BRUTUS	The name of honour more than I fear death.
BRUTUS	Another general shout!
BRUTUS	I do believe that these applauses are
BRUTUS	For some new honours that are heaped on Cæsar.
BRUTUS	That you do love me, I am nothing jealous;
BRUTUS	What you would work me to, I have some aim:
BRUTUS	How I have thought of this and of these times,
BRUTUS	I shall recount hereafter; for this present,
BRUTUS	I would not, so with love I might entreat you,
BRUTUS	Be any further mov'd. What you have said
BRUTUS	I will consider; what you have to say
BRUTUS	I will with patience hear, and find a time
BRUTUS	Both meet to hear and answer such high things.
BRUTUS	Till then, my noble friend, chew upon this:
BRUTUS	Brutus had rather be a villager
BRUTUS	Than to repute himself a son of Rome
BRUTUS	Under these hard conditions as this time
BRUTUS	Is like to lay upon us.
BRUTUS	The games are done and Cæsar is returning.
BRUTUS	I will do so. But, look you, Cassius,
BRUTUS	The angry spot doth glow on Cæsar's brow,
BRUTUS	And all the rest look like a chidden train:
BRUTUS	Calphurnia's cheek is pale, and Cicero
BRUTUS	Looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes
BRUTUS	As we have seen him in the Capitol,
BRUTUS	Being cross'd in conference by some senators.
BRUTUS	Ay, Casca; tell us what hath chanc'd to-day,
BRUTUS	That Cæsar looks so sad.
BRUTUS	I should not then ask Casca what had chanc'd.
BRUTUS	What was the second noise for?
BRUTUS	Was the crown offered him thrice?
BRUTUS	Tell us the manner of it, gentle Casca.
BRUTUS	'Tis very like: he hath the falling-sickness.
BRUTUS	What said he, when he came unto himself?
BRUTUS	And after that he came, thus sad, away?
BRUTUS	What a blunt fellow is this grown to be!
BRUTUS	He was quick mettle when he went to school.
BRUTUS	And so it is. For this time I will leave you:
BRUTUS	To-morrow, if you please to speak with me,
BRUTUS	I will come home to you; or, if you will,
BRUTUS	Come home to me, and I will wait for you.
BRUTUS	What, Lucius! ho!
BRUTUS	I cannot, by the progress of the stars,
BRUTUS	Give guess how near to day. Lucius, I say!
BRUTUS	I would it were my fault to sleep so soundly.
BRUTUS	When, Lucius, when! Awake, I say! what, Lucius!
BRUTUS	Get me a taper in my study, Lucius:
BRUTUS	When it is lighted, come and call me here.
BRUTUS	It must be by his death: and, for my part,
BRUTUS	I know no personal cause to spurn at him,
BRUTUS	But for the general. He would be crown'd:
BRUTUS	How that might change his nature, there's the question:
BRUTUS	It is the bright day that brings forth the adder;
BRUTUS	And that craves wary walking. Crown him?—that!
BRUTUS	And then, I grant, we put a sting in him,
BRUTUS	That at his will he may do danger with.
BRUTUS	The abuse of greatness is when it disjoins
BRUTUS	Remorse from power; and, to speak truth of Cæsar,
BRUTUS	I have not known when his affections sway'd
BRUTUS	More than his reason. But 'tis a common proof,
BRUTUS	That lowliness is young ambition's ladder,
BRUTUS	Whereto the climber-upward turns his face;
BRUTUS	But when he once attains the upmost round,
BRUTUS	He then unto the ladder turns his back,
BRUTUS	Looks in the clouds, scorning the base degrees
BRUTUS	By which he did ascend. So Cæsar may:
BRUTUS	Then, lest he may, prevent. And, since the quarrel
BRUTUS	Will bear no colour for the thing he is,
BRUTUS	Fashion it thus; that what he is, augmented,
BRUTUS	Would run to these and these extremities;
BRUTUS	And therefore think him as a serpent's egg
BRUTUS	Which, hatch'd, would, as his kind, grow mischievous,
BRUTUS	And kill him in the shell.
BRUTUS	Get you to bed again; it is not day.
BRUTUS	Is not to-morrow, boy, the ides of March?
BRUTUS	Look in the calendar, and bring me word.
BRUTUS	The exhalations whizzing in the air
BRUTUS	Give so much light that I may read by them.
BRUTUS	Brutus, thou sleep'st: awake and see thyself.
BRUTUS	Shall Rome, &c. Speak, strike, redress!
BRUTUS	Brutus, thou sleep'st: awake!
BRUTUS	Such instigations have been often dropp'd
BRUTUS	Where I have took them up.
BRUTUS	'Shall Rome, &c.' Thus must I piece it out:
BRUTUS	Shall Rome stand under one man's awe? What, Rome?
BRUTUS	My ancestors did from the streets of Rome
BRUTUS	The Tarquin drive, when he was call'd a king.
BRUTUS	'Speak, strike, redress!' Am I entreated
BRUTUS	To speak, and strike? O Rome! I make thee promise;
BRUTUS	If the redress will follow, thou receiv'st
BRUTUS	Thy full petition at the hand of Brutus!
BRUTUS	'Tis good. Go to the gate: somebody knocks.
BRUTUS	Since Cassius first did whet me against Cæsar,
BRUTUS	I have not slept.
BRUTUS	Between the acting of a dreadful thing
BRUTUS	And the first motion, all the interim is
BRUTUS	Like a phantasma, or a hideous dream:
BRUTUS	The genius and the mortal instruments
BRUTUS	Are then in council; and the state of man,
BRUTUS	Like to a little kingdom, suffers then
BRUTUS	The nature of an insurrection.
BRUTUS	Is he alone?
BRUTUS	Do you know them?
BRUTUS	Let 'em enter.
BRUTUS	They are the faction. O conspiracy!
BRUTUS	Sham'st thou to show thy dangerous brow by night,
BRUTUS	When evils are most free? O! then by day
BRUTUS	Where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough
BRUTUS	To mask thy monstrous visage? Seek none, conspiracy;
BRUTUS	Hide it in smiles and affability:
BRUTUS	For if thou path, thy native semblance on,
BRUTUS	Not Erebus itself were dim enough
BRUTUS	To hide thee from prevention.
BRUTUS	I have been up this hour, awake all night.
BRUTUS	Know I these men that come along with you?
BRUTUS	He is welcome hither.
BRUTUS	He is welcome too.
BRUTUS	They are all welcome.
BRUTUS	What watchful cares do interpose themselves
BRUTUS	Betwixt your eyes and night?
BRUTUS	Here lies the east: doth not the day break here?
BRUTUS	Give me your hands all over, one by one.
BRUTUS	No, not an oath: if not the face of men,
BRUTUS	The sufferance of our souls, the time's abuse,
BRUTUS	If these be motives weak, break off betimes,
BRUTUS	And every man hence to his idle bed;
BRUTUS	So let high-sighted tyranny range on,
BRUTUS	Till each man-drop by lottery. But if these,
BRUTUS	As I am sure they do, bear fire enough
BRUTUS	To kindle cowards and to steel with valour
BRUTUS	The melting spirits of women, then, countrymen,
BRUTUS	What need we any spur but our own cause
BRUTUS	To prick us to redress? what other bond
BRUTUS	Than secret Romans, that have spoke the word
BRUTUS	And will not palter? and what other oath
BRUTUS	Than honesty to honesty engag'd,
BRUTUS	That this shall be, or we will fall for it?
BRUTUS	Swear priests and cowards and men cautelous,
BRUTUS	Old feeble carrions and such suffering souls
BRUTUS	That welcome wrongs; unto bad causes swear
BRUTUS	Such creatures as men doubt; but do not stain
BRUTUS	The even virtue of our enterprise,
BRUTUS	Nor th' insuppressive mettle of our spirits,
BRUTUS	To think that or our cause or our performance
BRUTUS	Did need an oath; when every drop of blood
BRUTUS	That every Roman bears, and nobly bears,
BRUTUS	Is guilty of a several bastardy,
BRUTUS	If he do break the smallest particle
BRUTUS	Of any promise that hath pass'd from him.
BRUTUS	O! name him not: let us not break with him;
BRUTUS	For he will never follow any thing
BRUTUS	That other men begin.
BRUTUS	Shall no man else be touch'd but only Cæsar?
BRUTUS	Our course will seem too bloody, Caius Cassius,
BRUTUS	To cut the head off and then hack the limbs,
BRUTUS	Like wrath in death and envy afterwards;
BRUTUS	For Antony is but a limb of Cæsar.
BRUTUS	Let us be sacrificers, but not butchers, Caius.
BRUTUS	We all stand up against the spirit of Cæsar;
BRUTUS	And in the spirit of men there is no blood:
BRUTUS	O! then that we could come by Cæsar's spirit,
BRUTUS	And not dismember Cæsar. But, alas!
BRUTUS	Cæsar must bleed for it. And, gentle friends,
BRUTUS	Let's kill him boldly, but not wrathfully;
BRUTUS	Let's carve him as a dish fit for the gods,
BRUTUS	Not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds:
BRUTUS	And let our hearts, as subtle masters do,
BRUTUS	Stir up their servants to an act of rage,
BRUTUS	And after seem to chide 'em. This shall make
BRUTUS	Our purpose necessary and not envious;
BRUTUS	Which so appearing to the common eyes,
BRUTUS	We shall be call'd purgers, not murderers.
BRUTUS	And, for Mark Antony, think not of him;
BRUTUS	For he can do no more than Cæsar's arm
BRUTUS	When Cæsar's head is off.
BRUTUS	Alas! good Cassius, do not think of him:
BRUTUS	If he love Cæsar, all that he can do
BRUTUS	Is to himself, take thought and die for Cæsar:
BRUTUS	And that were much he should; for he is given
BRUTUS	To sports, to wildness, and much company.
BRUTUS	Peace! count the clock.
BRUTUS	Never fear that: if he be so resolv'd,
BRUTUS	I can o'ersway him; for he loves to hear
BRUTUS	That unicorns may be betray'd with trees,
BRUTUS	And bears with glasses, elephants with holes,
BRUTUS	Lions with toils, and men with flatterers;
BRUTUS	But when I tell him he hates flatterers,
BRUTUS	He says he does, being then most flattered.
BRUTUS	Let me work;
BRUTUS	For I can give his humour the true bent,
BRUTUS	And I will bring him to the Capitol.
BRUTUS	By the eighth hour: is that the uttermost?
BRUTUS	Now, good Metellus, go along by him:
BRUTUS	He loves me well, and I have given him reasons;
BRUTUS	Send him but hither, and I'll fashion him.
BRUTUS	Good gentlemen, look fresh and merrily;
BRUTUS	Let not our looks put on our purposes,
BRUTUS	But bear it as our Roman actors do,
BRUTUS	With untir'd spirits and formal constancy:
BRUTUS	And so good morrow to you every one.
BRUTUS	Boy! Lucius! Fast asleep? It is no matter;
BRUTUS	Enjoy the honey-heavy dew of slumber:
BRUTUS	Thou hast no figures nor no fantasies
BRUTUS	Which busy care draws in the brains of men;
BRUTUS	Therefore thou sleep'st so sound.
BRUTUS	Portia, what mean you? Wherefore rise you now?
BRUTUS	It is not for your health thus to commit
BRUTUS	Your weak condition to the raw cold morning.
BRUTUS	I am not well in health, and that is all.
BRUTUS	Why, so I do. Good Portia, go to bed.
BRUTUS	Kneel not, gentle Portia.
BRUTUS	You are my true and honourable wife,
BRUTUS	As dear to me as are the ruddy drops
BRUTUS	That visit my sad heart.
BRUTUS	O ye gods!
BRUTUS	Render me worthy of this noble wife.
BRUTUS	Hark, hark! one knocks. Portia, go in awhile;
BRUTUS	And by and by thy bosom shall partake
BRUTUS	The secrets of my heart.
BRUTUS	All my engagements I will construe to thee,
BRUTUS	All the charactery of my sad brows.
BRUTUS	Leave me with haste.
BRUTUS	Lucius, who's that knocks?
BRUTUS	Caius Ligarius, that Metellus spoke of.
BRUTUS	Boy, stand aside. Caius Ligarius! how?
BRUTUS	O! what a time have you chose out, brave Caius,
BRUTUS	To wear a kerchief. Would you were not sick.
BRUTUS	Such an exploit have I in hand, Ligarius,
BRUTUS	Had you a healthful ear to hear of it.
BRUTUS	A piece of work that will make sick men whole.
BRUTUS	That must we also. What it is, my Caius,
BRUTUS	I shall unfold to thee as we are going
BRUTUS	To whom it must be done.
BRUTUS	Follow me then.
BRUTUS	Cæsar, all hail! Good morrow, worthy Cæsar:
BRUTUS	I come to fetch you to the senate-house.
BRUTUS	Most mighty Cæsar, let me know some cause,
BRUTUS	Lest I be laugh'd at when I tell them so.
BRUTUS	This dream is all amiss interpreted;
BRUTUS	It was a vision fair and fortunate:
BRUTUS	Your statue spouting blood in many pipes,
BRUTUS	In which so many smiling Romans bath'd,
BRUTUS	Signifies that from you great Rome shall suck
BRUTUS	Reviving blood, and that great men shall press
BRUTUS	For tinctures, stains, relics, and cognizance.
BRUTUS	This by Calphurnia's dream is signified.
BRUTUS	I have, when you have heard what I can say:
BRUTUS	And know it now: the senate have concluded
BRUTUS	To give this day a crown to mighty Cæsar.
BRUTUS	If you shall send them word you will not come,
BRUTUS	Their minds may change. Besides, it were a mock
BRUTUS	Apt to be render'd, for some one to say
BRUTUS	'Break up the senate till another time,
BRUTUS	When Cæsar's wife shall meet with better dreams.'
BRUTUS	If Cæsar hide himself, shall they not whisper
BRUTUS	'Lo! Cæsar is afraid?'
BRUTUS	Pardon me, Cæsar; for my dear dear love
BRUTUS	To your proceeding bids me tell you this,
BRUTUS	And reason to my love is liable.
BRUTUS	Cæsar, 'tis strucken eight.
BRUTUS	That every like is not the same, O Cæsar!
BRUTUS	The heart of Brutus yearns to think upon.
BRUTUS	Trebonius doth desire you to o'er-read,
BRUTUS	At your best leisure, this his humble suit.
BRUTUS	What said Popilius Lena?
BRUTUS	Look, how he makes to Cæsar: mark him.
BRUTUS	Cassius, be constant:
BRUTUS	Popilius Lena speaks not of our purposes;
BRUTUS	For, look, he smiles, and Cæsar doth not change.
BRUTUS	Where is Metellus Cimber? Let him go,
BRUTUS	And presently prefer his suit to Cæsar.
BRUTUS	He is address'd; press near and second him.
BRUTUS	I kiss thy hand, but not in flattery, Cæsar;
BRUTUS	Desiring thee, that Publius Cimber may
BRUTUS	Have an immediate freedom of repeal.
BRUTUS	Great Cæsar,—
BRUTUS	People and senators be not affrighted;
BRUTUS	Fly not; stand still; ambition's debt is paid.
BRUTUS	And Cassius too.
BRUTUS	Where's Publius?
BRUTUS	Talk not of standing. Publius, good cheer;
BRUTUS	There is no harm intended to your person,
BRUTUS	Nor to no Roman else; so tell them, Publius.
BRUTUS	Do so; and let no man abide this deed
BRUTUS	But we the doers.
BRUTUS	Fates, we will know your pleasures.
BRUTUS	That we shall die, we know; 'tis but the time
BRUTUS	And drawing days out, that men stand upon.
BRUTUS	Grant that, and then is death a benefit:
BRUTUS	So are we Cæsar's friends, that have abridg'd
BRUTUS	His time of fearing death. Stoop, Romans, stoop,
BRUTUS	And let us bathe our hands in Cæsar's blood
BRUTUS	Up to the elbows, and besmear our swords:
BRUTUS	Then walk we forth, even to the market-place;
BRUTUS	And waving our red weapons o'er our heads,
BRUTUS	Let's all cry, 'Peace, freedom, and liberty!'
BRUTUS	How many times shall Cæsar bleed in sport,
BRUTUS	That now on Pompey's basis lies along
BRUTUS	No worthier than the dust!
BRUTUS	What! shall we forth?
BRUTUS	Soft! who comes here? A friend of Antony's.
BRUTUS	Thy master is a wise and valiant Roman;
BRUTUS	I never thought him worse.
BRUTUS	Tell him, so please him come unto this place,
BRUTUS	He shall be satisfied; and, by my honour,
BRUTUS	Depart untouch'd.
BRUTUS	I know that we shall have him well to friend.
BRUTUS	But here comes Antony. Welcome, Mark Antony.
BRUTUS	O Antony! beg not your death of us.
BRUTUS	Though now we must appear bloody and cruel,
BRUTUS	As, by our hands and this our present act,
BRUTUS	You see we do, yet see you but our hands
BRUTUS	And this the bleeding business they have done:
BRUTUS	Our hearts you see not; they are pitiful;
BRUTUS	And pity to the general wrong of Rome—
BRUTUS	As fire drives out fire, so pity pity—
BRUTUS	Hath done this deed on Cæsar. For your part,
BRUTUS	To you our swords have leaden points, Mark Antony;
BRUTUS	Our arms, in strength of malice, and our hearts
BRUTUS	Of brothers' temper, do receive you in
BRUTUS	With all kind love, good thoughts, and reverence.
BRUTUS	Only be patient till we have appeas'd
BRUTUS	The multitude, beside themselves with fear,
BRUTUS	And then we will deliver you the cause
BRUTUS	Why I, that did love Cæsar when I struck him,
BRUTUS	Have thus proceeded.
BRUTUS	Or else were this a savage spectacle.
BRUTUS	Our reasons are so full of good regard
BRUTUS	That were you, Antony, the son of Cæsar,
BRUTUS	You should be satisfied.
BRUTUS	You shall, Mark Antony.
BRUTUS	By your pardon;
BRUTUS	I will myself into the pulpit first,
BRUTUS	And show the reason of our Cæsar's death:
BRUTUS	What Antony shall speak, I will protest
BRUTUS	He speaks by leave and by permission,
BRUTUS	And that we are contented Cæsar shall
BRUTUS	Have all true rites and lawful ceremonies.
BRUTUS	It shall advantage more than do us wrong.
BRUTUS	Mark Antony, here, take you Cæsar's body.
BRUTUS	You shall not in your funeral speech blame us,
BRUTUS	But speak all good you can devise of Cæsar,
BRUTUS	And say you do 't by our permission;
BRUTUS	Else shall you not have any hand at all
BRUTUS	About his funeral; and you shall speak
BRUTUS	In the same pulpit whereto I am going,
BRUTUS	After my speech is ended.
BRUTUS	Prepare the body then, and follow us.
BRUTUS	Then follow me, and give me audience, friends.
BRUTUS	Cassius, go you into the other street,
BRUTUS	And part the numbers.
BRUTUS	Those that will hear me speak, let 'em stay here;
BRUTUS	Those that will follow Cassius, go with him;
BRUTUS	And public reasons shall be rendered
BRUTUS	Of Cæsar's death.
BRUTUS	Be patient till the last.
BRUTUS	Romans, countrymen, and lovers! hear me for my cause; and be silent, that you may hear: believe me for mine honour, and have respect to mine honour, that you may believe: censure me in your wisdom, and awake your senses, that you may the better judge. If there be any in this assembly, any dear friend of Cæsar's, to him I say, that Brutus' love to Cæsar was no less than his. If then that friend demand why Brutus rose against Cæsar, this is my answer: Not that I loved Cæsar less, but that I loved Rome more. Had you rather Cæsar were living, and die all slaves, than that Cæsar were dead, to live all free men? As Cæsar loved me, I weep for him; as he was fortunate, I rejoice at it; as he was valiant, I honour him; but, as he was ambitious, I slew him. There is tears for his love; joy for his fortune; honour for his valour; and death for his ambition. Who is here so base that would be a bondman? If any, speak; for him have I offended. Who is here so rude that would not be a Roman? If any, speak; for him have I offended. Who is here so vile that will not love his country? If any, speak; for him have I offended. I pause for a reply.
BRUTUS	Then none have I offended. I have done no more to Cæsar, than you shall do to Brutus. The question of his death is enrolled in the Capitol; his glory not extenuated, wherein he was worthy, nor his offences enforced, for which he suffered death.
BRUTUS	Here comes his body, mourned by Mark Antony: who, though he had no hand in his death, shall receive the benefit of his dying, a place in the commonwealth; as which of you shall not? With this I depart: that, as I slew my best lover for the good of Rome, I have the same dagger for myself, when it shall please my country to need my death.
BRUTUS	My countrymen,—
BRUTUS	Good countrymen, let me depart alone,
BRUTUS	And, for my sake, stay here with Antony.
BRUTUS	Do grace to Cæsar's corpse, and grace his speech
BRUTUS	Tending to Cæsar's glories, which Mark Antony,
BRUTUS	By our permission, is allow'd to make.
BRUTUS	I do entreat you, not a man depart,
BRUTUS	Save I alone, till Antony have spoke.
BRUTUS	Stand, ho!
BRUTUS	What now, Lucilius! is Cassius near?
BRUTUS	He greets me well. Your master, Pindarus,
BRUTUS	In his own change, or by ill officers,
BRUTUS	Hath given me some worthy cause to wish
BRUTUS	Things done, undone; but, if he be at hand,
BRUTUS	I shall be satisfied.
BRUTUS	He is not doubted. A word, Lucilius;
BRUTUS	How he receiv'd you, let me be resolv'd.
BRUTUS	Thou hast describ'd
BRUTUS	A hot friend cooling. Ever note, Lucilius,
BRUTUS	When love begins to sicken and decay,
BRUTUS	It useth an enforced ceremony.
BRUTUS	There are no tricks in plain and simple faith;
BRUTUS	But hollow men, like horses hot at hand,
BRUTUS	Make gallant show and promise of their mettle;
BRUTUS	But when they should endure the bloody spur,
BRUTUS	They fall their crests, and, like deceitful jades,
BRUTUS	Sink in the trial. Comes his army on?
BRUTUS	Hark! he is arriv'd.
BRUTUS	March gently on to meet him.
BRUTUS	Stand, ho! Speak the word along.
BRUTUS	Judge me, you gods! Wrong I mine enemies?
BRUTUS	And, if not so, how should I wrong a brother?
BRUTUS	Cassius, be content;
BRUTUS	Speak your griefs softly: I do know you well.
BRUTUS	Before the eyes of both our armies here,
BRUTUS	Which should perceive nothing but love from us,
BRUTUS	Let us not wrangle: bid them move away;
BRUTUS	Then in my tent, Cassius, enlarge your griefs,
BRUTUS	And I will give you audience.
BRUTUS	Lucilius, do you the like; and let no man
BRUTUS	Come to our tent till we have done our conference.
BRUTUS	Let Lucius and Titinius guard our door.
BRUTUS	You wrong'd yourself to write in such a case.
BRUTUS	Let me tell you, Cassius, you yourself
BRUTUS	Are much condemn'd to have an itching palm;
BRUTUS	To sell and mart your offices for gold
BRUTUS	To undeservera.
BRUTUS	The name of Cassius honours this corruption,
BRUTUS	And chastisement doth therefore hide his head.
BRUTUS	Remember March, the ides of March remember:
BRUTUS	Did not great Julius bleed for justice' sake?
BRUTUS	What villain touch'd his body, that did stab,
BRUTUS	And not for justice? What! shall one of us,
BRUTUS	That struck the foremost man of all this world
BRUTUS	But for supporting robbers, shall we now
BRUTUS	Contaminate our fingers with base bribes,
BRUTUS	And sell the mighty space of our large honours
BRUTUS	For so much trash as may be grasped thus?
BRUTUS	I had rather be a dog, and bay the moon,
BRUTUS	Than such a Roman.
BRUTUS	Go to; you are not, Cassius.
BRUTUS	I say you are not.
BRUTUS	Away, slight man!
BRUTUS	Hear me, for I will speak.
BRUTUS	Must I give way and room to your rash choler?
BRUTUS	Shall I be frighted when a madman stares?
BRUTUS	All this! ay, more: fret till your proud heart break;
BRUTUS	Go show your slaves how choleric you are,
BRUTUS	And make your bondmen tremble. Must I budge?
BRUTUS	Must I observe you? Must I stand and crouch
BRUTUS	Under your testy humour? By the gods,
BRUTUS	You shall digest the venom of your spleen,
BRUTUS	Though it do split you; for, from this day forth,
BRUTUS	I'll use you for my mirth, yea, for my laughter,
BRUTUS	When you are waspish.
BRUTUS	You say you are a better soldier:
BRUTUS	Let it appear so; make your vaunting true,
BRUTUS	And it shall please me well. For mine own part,
BRUTUS	I shall be glad to learn of noble men.
BRUTUS	If you did, I care not.
BRUTUS	Peace, peace! you durst not so have tempted him.
BRUTUS	No.
BRUTUS	For your life you durst not.
BRUTUS	You have done that you should be sorry for.
BRUTUS	There is no terror, Cassius, in your threats;
BRUTUS	For I am arm'd so strong in honesty
BRUTUS	That they pass by me as the idle wind,
BRUTUS	Which I respect not. I did send to you
BRUTUS	For certain sums of gold, which you denied me;
BRUTUS	For I can raise no money by vile means:
BRUTUS	By heaven, I had rather coin my heart,
BRUTUS	And drop my blood for drachmas, than to wring
BRUTUS	From the hard hands of peasants their vile trash
BRUTUS	By any indirection. I did send
BRUTUS	To you for gold to pay my legions,
BRUTUS	Which you denied me: was that done like Cassius?
BRUTUS	Should I have answer'd Caius Cassius so?
BRUTUS	When Marcus Brutus grows so covetous,
BRUTUS	To lock such rascal counters from his friends,
BRUTUS	Be ready, gods, with all your thunderbolts;
BRUTUS	Dash him to pieces!
BRUTUS	You did.
BRUTUS	I do not, till you practise them on me.
BRUTUS	I do not like your faults.
BRUTUS	A flatterer's would not, though they do appear
BRUTUS	As huge as high Olympus.
BRUTUS	Sheathe your dagger:
BRUTUS	Be angry when you will, it shall have scope;
BRUTUS	Do what you will, dishonour shall be humour.
BRUTUS	O Cassius! you are yoked with a lamb
BRUTUS	That carries anger as the flint bears fire,
BRUTUS	Who, much enforced, shows a hasty spark,
BRUTUS	And straight is cold again.
BRUTUS	When I spoke that I was ill-temper'd too.
BRUTUS	And my heart too.
BRUTUS	What's the matter?
BRUTUS	Yes, Cassius; and from henceforth
BRUTUS	When you are over-earnest with your Brutus,
BRUTUS	He'll think your mother chides, and leave you so.
BRUTUS	Get you hence, sirrah; saucy fellow, hence!
BRUTUS	I'll know his humour, when he knows his time:
BRUTUS	What should the wars do with these jigging fools?
BRUTUS	Companion, hence!
BRUTUS	Lucilius and Titinius, bid the commanders
BRUTUS	Prepare to lodge their companies to-night.
BRUTUS	Lucius, a bowl of wine!
BRUTUS	O Cassius! I am sick of many griefs.
BRUTUS	No man bears sorrow better: Portia is dead.
BRUTUS	She is dead.
BRUTUS	Impatient of my absence,
BRUTUS	And grief that young Octavius with Mark Antony
BRUTUS	Have made themselves so strong;—for with her death
BRUTUS	That tidings came:—with this she fell distract,
BRUTUS	And, her attendants absent, swallow'd fire.
BRUTUS	Even so.
BRUTUS	Speak no more of her. Give me a bowl of wine.
BRUTUS	In this I bury all unkindness, Cassius.
BRUTUS	Come in, Titinius.
BRUTUS	Welcome, good Messala.
BRUTUS	Now sit we close about this taper here,
BRUTUS	And call in question our necessities.
BRUTUS	No more, I pray you.
BRUTUS	Messala, I have here received letters,
BRUTUS	That young Octavius and Mark Antony
BRUTUS	Come down upon us with a mighty power,
BRUTUS	Bending their expedition towards Philippi.
BRUTUS	With what addition?
BRUTUS	Therein our letters do not well agree;
BRUTUS	Mine speak of seventy senators that died
BRUTUS	By their proscriptions, Cicero being one.
BRUTUS	No, Messala.
BRUTUS	Nothing, Messala.
BRUTUS	Why ask you? Hear you aught of her in yours?
BRUTUS	Now, as you are a Roman, tell me true.
BRUTUS	Why, farewell, Portia. We must die, Messala:
BRUTUS	With meditating that she must die once,
BRUTUS	I have the patience to endure it now.
BRUTUS	Well, to our work alive. What do you think
BRUTUS	Of marching to Philippi presently?
BRUTUS	Your reason?
BRUTUS	Good reasons must, of force, give place to better,
BRUTUS	The people 'twixt Philippi and this ground
BRUTUS	Do stand but in a forc'd affection;
BRUTUS	For they have grudg'd us contribution:
BRUTUS	The enemy, marching along by them,
BRUTUS	By them shall make a fuller number up,
BRUTUS	Come on refresh'd, new-added, and encourag'd;
BRUTUS	From which advantage shall we cut him off,
BRUTUS	If at Philippi we do face him there,
BRUTUS	These people at our back.
BRUTUS	Under your pardon. You must note beside,
BRUTUS	That we have tried the utmost of our friends,
BRUTUS	Our legions are brim-full, our cause is ripe:
BRUTUS	The enemy increaseth every day;
BRUTUS	We, at the height, are ready to decline.
BRUTUS	There is a tide in the affairs of men,
BRUTUS	Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune;
BRUTUS	Omitted, all the voyage of their life
BRUTUS	Is bound in shallows and in miseries.
BRUTUS	On such a full sea are we now afloat;
BRUTUS	And we must take the current when it serves,
BRUTUS	Or lose our ventures.
BRUTUS	The deep of night is crept upon our talk,
BRUTUS	And nature must obey necessity,
BRUTUS	Which we will niggard with a little rest.
BRUTUS	There is no more to say?
BRUTUS	Lucius!
BRUTUS	My gown.
BRUTUS	Farewell, good Messala:
BRUTUS	Good-night, Titinius. Noble, noble Cassius,
BRUTUS	Good-night, and good repose.
BRUTUS	Every thing is well.
BRUTUS	Good-night, good brother.
BRUTUS	Farewell, every one.
BRUTUS	Give me the gown. Where is thy instrument?
BRUTUS	What! thou speak'st drowsily?
BRUTUS	Poor knave, I blame thee not; thou art o'erwatch'd.
BRUTUS	Call Claudius and some other of my men;
BRUTUS	I'll have them sleep on cushions in my tent.
BRUTUS	I pray you, sirs, lie in my tent and sleep:
BRUTUS	It may be I shall raise you by and by
BRUTUS	On business to my brother Cassius.
BRUTUS	I will not have it so; lie down, good sirs;
BRUTUS	It may be I shall otherwise bethink me.
BRUTUS	Look, Lucius, here's the book I sought for so;
BRUTUS	I put it in the pocket of my gown.
BRUTUS	Bear with me, good boy, I am much forgetful.
BRUTUS	Canst thou hold up thy heavy eyes awhile,
BRUTUS	And touch thy instrument a strain or two?
BRUTUS	It does, my boy:
BRUTUS	I trouble thee too much, but thou art willing.
BRUTUS	I should not urge thy duty past thy might;
BRUTUS	I know young bloods look for a time of rest.
BRUTUS	It was well done, and thou shalt sleep again;
BRUTUS	I will not hold thee long: if I do live,
BRUTUS	I will be good to thee.
BRUTUS	This is a sleepy tune: O murderous slumber!
BRUTUS	Lay'st thou thy leaden mace upon my boy,
BRUTUS	That plays thee music? Gentle knave, good-night;
BRUTUS	I will not do thee so much wrong to wake thee.
BRUTUS	If thou dost nod, thou break'st thy instrument;
BRUTUS	I'll take it from thee; and, good boy, good-night.
BRUTUS	Let me see, let me see; is not the leaf turn'd down
BRUTUS	Where I left reading? Here it is, I think.
BRUTUS	How ill this taper burns! Ha! who comes here?
BRUTUS	I think it is the weakness of mine eyes
BRUTUS	That shapes this monstrous apparition.
BRUTUS	It comes upon me. Art thou any thing?
BRUTUS	Art thou some god, some angel, or some devil,
BRUTUS	That mak'st my blood cold and my hair to stare?
BRUTUS	Speak to me what thou art.
BRUTUS	Why com'st thou?
BRUTUS	Well; then I shall see thee again?
BRUTUS	Why, I will see thee at Philippi then.
BRUTUS	Now I have taken heart thou vanishest:
BRUTUS	Ill spirit, I would hold more talk with thee.
BRUTUS	Boy, Lucius! Varro! Claudius! Sirs, awake!
BRUTUS	Claudius!
BRUTUS	He thinks he still is at his instrument.
BRUTUS	Lucius, awake!
BRUTUS	Didst thou dream, Lucius, that thou so criedst out?
BRUTUS	Yes, that thou didst. Didst thou see any thing?
BRUTUS	Sleep again, Lucius. Sirrah, Claudius!
BRUTUS	Fellow thou! awake!
BRUTUS	Why did you so cry out, sirs, in your sleep?
BRUTUS	Ay: saw you any thing?
BRUTUS	Go, and commend me to my brother Cassius.
BRUTUS	Bid him set on his powers betimes before,
BRUTUS	And we will follow.
BRUTUS	They stand, and would have parley.
BRUTUS	Words before blows: is it so, countrymen?
BRUTUS	Good words are better than bad strokes, Octavius.
BRUTUS	O! yes, and soundless too;
BRUTUS	For you have stol'n their buzzing, Antony,
BRUTUS	And very wisely threat before you sting.
BRUTUS	Cæsar, thou canst not die by traitors' hands,
BRUTUS	Unless thou bring'st them with thee.
BRUTUS	O! if thou wert the noblest of thy strain,
BRUTUS	Young man, thou couldst not die more honourable.
BRUTUS	Ho!
BRUTUS	Lucilius! hark, a word with you.
BRUTUS	Even so, Lucilius.
BRUTUS	Even by the rule of that philosophy
BRUTUS	By which I did blame Cato for the death
BRUTUS	Which he did give himself; I know not how,
BRUTUS	But I do find it cowardly and vile,
BRUTUS	For fear of what might fall, so to prevent
BRUTUS	The time of life: arming myself with patience,
BRUTUS	To stay the providence of some high powers
BRUTUS	That govern us below.
BRUTUS	No, Cassius, no: think not, thou noble Roman,
BRUTUS	That ever Brutus will go bound to Rome;
BRUTUS	He bears too great a mind: but this same day
BRUTUS	Must end that work the ides of March begun;
BRUTUS	And whether we shall meet again I know not.
BRUTUS	Therefore our everlasting farewell take:
BRUTUS	For ever, and for ever, farewell, Cassius!
BRUTUS	If we do meet again, why, we shall smile;
BRUTUS	If not, why then, this parting was well made.
BRUTUS	Why, then, lead on. O! that a man might know
BRUTUS	The end of this day's business, ere it come;
BRUTUS	But it sufficeth that the day will end,
BRUTUS	And then the end is known. Come, ho! away!
BRUTUS	Ride, ride, Messala, ride, and give these bills
BRUTUS	Unto the legions on the other side.
BRUTUS	Let them set on at once, for I perceive
BRUTUS	But cold demeanour in Octavius' wing,
BRUTUS	And sudden push gives them the overthrow.
BRUTUS	Ride, ride, Messala: let them all come down.
BRUTUS	Where, where, Messala, doth his body lie?
BRUTUS	Titinius' face is upward.
BRUTUS	O Julius Cæsar! thou art mighty yet!
BRUTUS	Thy spirit walks abroad, and turns our swords
BRUTUS	In our own proper entrails.
BRUTUS	Are yet two Romans living such as these?
BRUTUS	The last of all the Romans, fare thee well!
BRUTUS	It is impossible that ever Rome
BRUTUS	Should breed thy fellow. Friends, I owe more tears
BRUTUS	To this dead man than you shall see me pay.—
BRUTUS	I shall find time, Cassius, I shall find time.—
BRUTUS	Come therefore, and to Thassos send his body:
BRUTUS	His funerals shall not be in our camp,
BRUTUS	Lest it discomfort us. Lucilius, come;
BRUTUS	And come, young Cato;—let us to the field.
BRUTUS	Labeo and Flavius, set our battles on:—
BRUTUS	'Tis three o'clock; and, Romans, yet ere night
BRUTUS	We shall try fortune in a second fight.
BRUTUS	Yet, countrymen, O! yet hold up your heads!
BRUTUS	And I am Brutus, Marcus Brutus, I;
BRUTUS	Brutus, my country's friend; know me for Brutus!
BRUTUS	Come, poor remains of friends, rest on this rock.
BRUTUS	Sit thee down, Clitus: slaying is the word;
BRUTUS	It is a deed in fashion. Hark thee, Clitus.
BRUTUS	Peace, then! no words.
BRUTUS	Hark thee, Dardanius.
BRUTUS	Come hither, good Volumnius: list a word.
BRUTUS	Why this, Volumnius:
BRUTUS	The ghost of Cæsar hath appear'd to me
BRUTUS	Two several times by night; at Sardis once,
BRUTUS	And this last night here in Philippi fields.
BRUTUS	I know my hour is come.
BRUTUS	Nay, I am sure it is, Volumnius.
BRUTUS	Thou seest the world, Volumnius, how it goes;
BRUTUS	Our enemies have beat us to the pit:
BRUTUS	It is more worthy to leap in ourselves,
BRUTUS	Than tarry till they push us. Good Volumnius,
BRUTUS	Thou know'st that we two went to school together:
BRUTUS	Even for that our love of old, I prithee,
BRUTUS	Hold thou my sword-hilts, whilst I run on it.
BRUTUS	Farewell to you; and you; and you, Volumnius.
BRUTUS	Strato, thou hast been all this while asleep;
BRUTUS	Farewell to thee too, Strato. Countrymen,
BRUTUS	My heart doth joy that yet, in all my life,
BRUTUS	I found no man but he was true to me.
BRUTUS	I shall have glory by this losing day,
BRUTUS	More than Octavius and Mark Antony
BRUTUS	By this vile conquest shall attain unto.
BRUTUS	So fare you well at once; for Brutus' tongue
BRUTUS	Hath almost ended his life's history:
BRUTUS	Night hangs upon mine eyes; my bones would rest,
BRUTUS	That have but labour'd to attain this hour.
BRUTUS	Hence! I will follow.
BRUTUS	I prithee, Strato, stay thou by thy lord:
BRUTUS	Thou art a fellow of a good respect;
BRUTUS	Thy life hath had some smatch of honour in it:
BRUTUS	Hold then my sword, and turn away thy face,
BRUTUS	While I do run upon it. Wilt thou, Strato?
BRUTUS	Farewell, good Strato.—
BRUTUS	Cæsar, now be still;
BRUTUS	I kill'd not thee with half so good a will.
CAPULET	What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!
CAPULET	My sword, I say! Old Montague is come,
CAPULET	And flourishes his blade in spite of me.
CAPULET	But Montague is bound as well as I,
CAPULET	In penalty alike; and 'tis not hard, I think,
CAPULET	For men so old as we to keep the peace.
CAPULET	But saying o'er what I have said before:
CAPULET	My child is yet a stranger in the world,
CAPULET	She hath not seen the change of fourteen years;
CAPULET	Let two more summers wither in their pride
CAPULET	Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
CAPULET	And too soon marr'd are those so early made.
CAPULET	Earth hath swallow'd all my hopes but she,
CAPULET	She is the hopeful lady of my earth:
CAPULET	But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart,
CAPULET	My will to her consent is but a part;
CAPULET	An she agree, within her scope of choice
CAPULET	Lies my consent and fair according voice.
CAPULET	This night I hold an old accustom'd feast,
CAPULET	Whereto I have invited many a guest
CAPULET	Such as I love; and you, among the store,
CAPULET	One more, most welcome, makes my number more.
CAPULET	At my poor house look to behold this night
CAPULET	Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light:
CAPULET	Such comfort as do lusty young men feel
CAPULET	When well-apparel'd April on the heel
CAPULET	Of limping winter treads, even such delight
CAPULET	Among fresh female buds shall you this night
CAPULET	Inherit at my house; hear all, all see,
CAPULET	And like her most whose merit most shall be:
CAPULET	Which on more view, of many mine being one
CAPULET	May stand in number, though in reckoning none.
CAPULET	Come, go with me.
CAPULET	Go, sirrah, trudge about
CAPULET	Through fair Verona; find those persons out
CAPULET	Whose names are written there, and to them say,
CAPULET	My house and welcome on their pleasure stay.
CAPULET	Welcome, gentlemen! ladies that have their toes
CAPULET	Unplagu'd with corns will walk a bout with you.
CAPULET	Ah ha! my mistresses, which of you all
CAPULET	Will now deny to dance? she that makes dainty, she,
CAPULET	I'll swear, hath corns; am I come near ye now?
CAPULET	Welcome, gentlemen! I have seen the day
CAPULET	That I have worn a visor, and could tell
CAPULET	A whispering tale in a fair lady's ear
CAPULET	Such as would please; 'tis gone, 'tis gone, 'tis gone.
CAPULET	You are welcome, gentlemen! Come, musicians, play.
CAPULET	A hall! a hall! give room, and foot it, girls.
CAPULET	More light, ye knaves! and turn the tables up,
CAPULET	And quench the fire, the room has grown too hot.
CAPULET	Ah! sirrah, this unlook'd-for sport comes well.
CAPULET	Nay, sit, nay, sit, good cousin Capulet,
CAPULET	For you and I are past our dancing days;
CAPULET	How long is 't now since last yourself and I
CAPULET	Were in a mask?
CAPULET	What, man! 'tis not so much, 'tis not so much:
CAPULET	'Tis since the nuptial of Lucentio,
CAPULET	Come Pentecost as quickly as it will,
CAPULET	Some five and twenty years; and then we mask'd.
CAPULET	Will you tell me that?
CAPULET	His son was but a ward two years ago.
CAPULET	Why, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so?
CAPULET	Young Romeo, is it?
CAPULET	Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone:
CAPULET	He bears him like a portly gentleman;
CAPULET	And, to say truth, Verona brags of him
CAPULET	To be a virtuous and well-govern'd youth.
CAPULET	I would not for the wealth of all this town
CAPULET	Here in my house do him disparagement;
CAPULET	Therefore be patient, take no note of him:
CAPULET	It is my will; the which if thou respect,
CAPULET	Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,
CAPULET	An ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.
CAPULET	He shall be endur'd:
CAPULET	What! goodman boy; I say, he shall, go to;
CAPULET	Am I the master here, or you? go to.
CAPULET	You'll not endure him! God shall mend my soul!
CAPULET	You'll make a mutiny among my guests!
CAPULET	You will set cock-a-hoop! you'll be the man!
CAPULET	Go to, go to;
CAPULET	You are a saucy boy—is't so indeed?—
CAPULET	This trick may chance to scathe you.—I know what:
CAPULET	You must contrary me! marry, 'tis time.
CAPULET	Well said, my hearts! You are a princox; go:
CAPULET	Be quiet, or—More light, more light!—For shame!
CAPULET	I'll make you quiet. What! cheerly, my hearts!
CAPULET	Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone;
CAPULET	We have a trifling foolish banquet towards.
CAPULET	Is it e'en so? Why then, I thank you all;
CAPULET	I thank you, honest gentlemen; good-night.
CAPULET	More torches here! Come on then, let's to bed.
CAPULET	Ah! sirrah, by my fay, it waxes late;
CAPULET	I'll to my rest.
CAPULET	Things have fall'n out, sir, so unluckily,
CAPULET	That we have had no time to move our daughter:
CAPULET	Look you, she lov'd her kinsman Tybalt dearly,
CAPULET	And so did I: well, we were born to die.
CAPULET	'Tis very late, she'll not come down to night:
CAPULET	I promise you, but for your company,
CAPULET	I would have been a-bed an hour ago.
CAPULET	Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender
CAPULET	Of my child's love: I think she will be rul'd
CAPULET	In all respects by me; nay, more, I doubt it not.
CAPULET	Wife go you to her ere you go to bed;
CAPULET	Acquaint her here of my son Paris' love;
CAPULET	And bid her, mark you me, on Wednesday next—
CAPULET	But, soft! what day is this?
CAPULET	Monday! ha, ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon;
CAPULET	O' Thursday let it be: o' Thursday, tell her,
CAPULET	She shall be married to this noble earl.
CAPULET	Will you be ready? do you like this haste?
CAPULET	We'll keep no great ado; a friend or two;
CAPULET	For, hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,
CAPULET	It may be thought we held him carelessly,
CAPULET	Being our kinsman, if we revel much.
CAPULET	Therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends,
CAPULET	And there an end. But what say you to Thursday?
CAPULET	Well, get you gone: o' Thursday be it then.
CAPULET	Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed,
CAPULET	Prepare her, wife, against this wedding-day.
CAPULET	Farewell, my lord. Light to my chamber, ho!
CAPULET	Afore me! it is so very very late,
CAPULET	That we may call it early by and by.
CAPULET	Good-night.
CAPULET	When the sun sets, the air doth drizzle dew;
CAPULET	But for the sunset of my brother's son
CAPULET	It rains downright.
CAPULET	How now! a conduit, girl? what! still in tears?
CAPULET	Evermore showering? In one little body
CAPULET	Thou counterfeit'st a bark, a sea, a wind;
CAPULET	For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,
CAPULET	Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is,
CAPULET	Sailing in this salt flood; the winds, thy sighs;
CAPULET	Who, raging with thy tears, and they with them,
CAPULET	Without a sudden calm, will overset
CAPULET	Thy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife!
CAPULET	Have you deliver'd to her our decree?
CAPULET	Soft! take me with you, take me with you, wife.
CAPULET	How! will she none? doth she not give us thanks?
CAPULET	Is she not proud? doth she not count her bless'd,
CAPULET	Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought
CAPULET	So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?
CAPULET	How now! how now, chop-logic! What is this?
CAPULET	'Proud,' and 'I thank you,' and 'I thank you not;'
CAPULET	And yet 'not proud;' mistress minion, you,
CAPULET	Thank me no thankings, nor proud me no prouds,
CAPULET	But fettle your fine joints 'gainst Thursday next,
CAPULET	To go with Paris to Saint Peter's church,
CAPULET	Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.
CAPULET	Out, you green-sickness carrion! out, you baggage!
CAPULET	You tallow face!
CAPULET	Hang thee, young baggage! disobedient wretch!
CAPULET	I tell thee what, get thee to church o' Thursday,
CAPULET	Or never after look me in the face.
CAPULET	Speak not, reply not, do not answer me;
CAPULET	My fingers itch.—Wife, we scarce thought us bless'd
CAPULET	That God had lent us but this only child;
CAPULET	But now I see this one is one too much,
CAPULET	And that we have a curse in having her.
CAPULET	Out on her, hilding!
CAPULET	And why, my lady wisdom? hold your tongue,
CAPULET	Good prudence; smatter with your gossips, go.
CAPULET	O! God ye good den.
CAPULET	Peace, you mumbling fool;
CAPULET	Utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl;
CAPULET	For here we need it not.
CAPULET	God's bread! it makes me mad.
CAPULET	Day, night, hour, tide, time, work, play,
CAPULET	Alone, in company, still my care hath been
CAPULET	To have her match'd; and having now provided
CAPULET	A gentleman of noble parentage,
CAPULET	Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly train'd,
CAPULET	Stuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts,
CAPULET	Proportion'd as one's thought would wish a man;
CAPULET	And then to have a wretched puling fool,
CAPULET	A whining mammet, in her fortune's tender,
CAPULET	To answer 'I'll not wed,' 'I cannot love,'
CAPULET	'I am too young,' 'I pray you, pardon me;'
CAPULET	But, an you will not wed, I'll pardon you:
CAPULET	Graze where you will, you shall not house with me:
CAPULET	Look to't, think on't, I do not use to jest.
CAPULET	Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise.
CAPULET	An you be mine, I'll give you to my friend;
CAPULET	An you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in the streets,
CAPULET	For, by my soul, I'll ne'er acknowledge thee,
CAPULET	Nor what is mine shall never do thee good.
CAPULET	Trust to't, bethink you; I'll not be forsworn.
CAPULET	So many guests invite as here are writ.
CAPULET	Sirrah, go hire me twenty cunning cooks.
CAPULET	How canst thou try them so?
CAPULET	Go, be gone.
CAPULET	We shall be much unfurnish'd for this time.
CAPULET	What! is my daughter gone to Friar Laurence?
CAPULET	Well, he may chance to do some good on her:
CAPULET	A peevish self-will'd harlotry it is.
CAPULET	How now, my headstrong! where have you been gadding?
CAPULET	Send for the county; go tell him of this:
CAPULET	I'll have this knot knit up to-morrow morning.
CAPULET	Why, I'm glad on't; this is well: stand up:
CAPULET	This is as't should be. Let me see the county;
CAPULET	Ay, marry, go, I say, and fetch him hither.
CAPULET	Now, afore God! this reverend holy friar,
CAPULET	All our whole city is much bound to him.
CAPULET	Go, nurse, go with her. We'll to church to-morrow.
CAPULET	Tush! I will stir about,
CAPULET	And all things shall be well, I warrant thee, wife:
CAPULET	Go thou to Juliet, help to deck up her;
CAPULET	I'll not to bed to-night; let me alone;
CAPULET	I'll play the housewife for this once. What, ho!
CAPULET	They are all forth: well, I will walk myself
CAPULET	To County Paris; to prepare him up
CAPULET	Against to-morrow. My heart is wondrous light,
CAPULET	Since this same wayward girl is so reclaim'd.
CAPULET	Come, stir, stir, stir! the second cock hath crow'd,
CAPULET	The curfew bell hath rung, 'tis three o'clock:
CAPULET	Look to the bak'd meats, good Angelica:
CAPULET	Spare not for cost.
CAPULET	No, not a whit; what! I have watch'd ere now
CAPULET	All night for lesser cause, and ne'er been sick.
CAPULET	A jealous-hood, a jealous-hood!
CAPULET	Now, fellow,
CAPULET	What's there?
CAPULET	Make haste, make haste.
CAPULET	Sirrah, fetch drier logs:
CAPULET	Call Peter, he will show thee where they are.
CAPULET	Mass, and well said; a merry whoreson, ha!
CAPULET	Thou shalt be logger-head. Good faith! 'tis day:
CAPULET	The county will be here with music straight,
CAPULET	For so he said he would.
CAPULET	I hear him near.
CAPULET	Nurse! Wife! what, ho! What, nurse, I say!
CAPULET	Go waken Juliet, go and trim her up;
CAPULET	I'll go and chat with Paris. Hie, make haste,
CAPULET	Make haste; the bridegroom he is come already:
CAPULET	Make haste, I say.
CAPULET	For shame! bring Juliet forth; her lord is come.
CAPULET	Ha! let me see her. Out, alas! she's cold;
CAPULET	Her blood is settled, and her joints are stiff;
CAPULET	Life and these lips have long been separated:
CAPULET	Death lies on her like an untimely frost
CAPULET	Upon the sweetest flower of all the field.
CAPULET	Death, that hath ta'en her hence to make me wail,
CAPULET	Ties up my tongue, and will not let me speak.
CAPULET	Ready to go, but never to return.
CAPULET	O son! the night before thy wedding-day
CAPULET	Hath Death lain with thy wife. There she lies,
CAPULET	Flower as she was, deflowered by him.
CAPULET	Death is my son-in-law, Death is my heir;
CAPULET	My daughter he hath wedded: I will die,
CAPULET	And leave him all; life, living, all is Death's!
CAPULET	Despis'd, distressed, hated, martyr'd, kill'd!
CAPULET	Uncomfortable time, why cam'st thou now
CAPULET	To murder, murder our solemnity?
CAPULET	O child! O child! my soul, and not my child!
CAPULET	Dead art thou! dead! alack, my child is dead;
CAPULET	And with my child my joys are buried!
CAPULET	All things that we ordained festival,
CAPULET	Turn from their office to black funeral;
CAPULET	Our instruments to melancholy bells,
CAPULET	Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast,
CAPULET	Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change,
CAPULET	Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse,
CAPULET	And all things change them to the contrary.
CAPULET	What should it be, that they so shriek abroad?
CAPULET	O, heaven!—O wife! look how our daughter bleeds!
CAPULET	This dagger hath mista'en!—for, lo, his house
CAPULET	Is empty on the back of Montague—
CAPULET	And is mis-sheathed in my daughter's bosom.
CAPULET	O brother Montague! give me thy hand:
CAPULET	This is my daughter's jointure, for no more
CAPULET	Can I demand.
CAPULET	As rich shall Romeo by his lady lie;
CAPULET	Poor sacrifices of our enmity!
CASCA	Peace, ho! Cæsar speaks.
CASCA	Bid every noise be still: peace yet again!
CASCA	Fellow, come from the throng; look upon Cæsar.
CASCA	Will you go see the order of the course?
CASCA	I pray you, do.
CASCA	Brutus, I do observe you now of late:
CASCA	I have not from your eyes that gentleness
CASCA	And show of love as I was wont to have:
CASCA	You bear too stubborn and too strange a hand
CASCA	Over your friend that loves you.
CASCA	Then, Brutus, I have much mistook your passion;
CASCA	By means whereof this breast of mine hath buried
CASCA	Thoughts of great value, worthy cogitations.
CASCA	Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your face?
CASCA	'Tis just:
CASCA	And it is very much lamented, Brutus,
CASCA	That you have no such mirrors as will turn
CASCA	Your hidden worthiness into your eye,
CASCA	That you might see your shadow. I have heard,
CASCA	Where many of the best respect in Rome,—
CASCA	Except immortal Cæsar,—speaking of Brutus,
CASCA	And groaning underneath this age's yoke,
CASCA	Have wish'd that noble Brutus had his eyes.
CASCA	Therefore, good Brutus, be prepar'd to hear;
CASCA	And, since you know you cannot see yourself
CASCA	So well as by reflection, I, your glass,
CASCA	Will modestly discover to yourself
CASCA	That of yourself which you yet know not of.
CASCA	And be not jealous on me, gentle Brutus:
CASCA	Were I a common laugher, or did use
CASCA	To stale with ordinary oaths my love
CASCA	To every new protester; if you know
CASCA	That I do fawn on men and hug them hard,
CASCA	And after scandal them; or if you know
CASCA	That I profess myself in banqueting
CASCA	To all the rout, then hold me dangerous.
CASCA	Ay, do you fear it?
CASCA	Then must I think you would not have it so.
CASCA	I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus,
CASCA	As well as I do know your outward favour.
CASCA	Well, honour is the subject of my story.
CASCA	I cannot tell what you and other men
CASCA	Think of this life; but, for my single self,
CASCA	I had as lief not be as live to be
CASCA	In awe of such a thing as I myself.
CASCA	I was born free as Cæsar; so were you:
CASCA	We both have fed as well, and we can both
CASCA	Endure the winter's cold as well as he:
CASCA	For once, upon a raw and gusty day,
CASCA	The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores,
CASCA	Cæsar said to me, 'Dar'st thou, Cassius, now
CASCA	Leap in with me into this angry flood,
CASCA	And swim to yonder point?' Upon the word,
CASCA	Accoutred as I was, I plunged in
CASCA	And bade him follow; so, indeed he did.
CASCA	The torrent roar'd, and we did buffet it
CASCA	With lusty sinews, throwing it aside
CASCA	And stemming it with hearts of controversy;
CASCA	But ere we could arrive the point propos'd,
CASCA	Cæsar cried, 'Help me, Cassius, or I sink!'
CASCA	I, as Æneas, our great ancestor,
CASCA	Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder
CASCA	The old Anchises bear, so from the waves of Tiber
CASCA	Did I the tired Cæsar. And this man
CASCA	Is now become a god, and Cassius is
CASCA	A wretched creature and must bend his body
CASCA	If Cæsar carelessly but nod on him.
CASCA	He had a fever when he was in Spain,
CASCA	And when the fit was on him, I did mark
CASCA	How he did shake; 'tis true, this god did shake;
CASCA	His coward lips did from their colour fly,
CASCA	And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world
CASCA	Did lose his lustre; I did hear him groan;
CASCA	Ay, and that tongue of his that bade the Romans
CASCA	Mark him and write his speeches in their books,
CASCA	Alas! it cried, 'Give me some drink, Titinius,'
CASCA	As a sick girl. Ye gods, it doth amaze me,
CASCA	A man of such a feeble temper should
CASCA	So get the start of the majestic world,
CASCA	And bear the palm alone.
CASCA	Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world
CASCA	Like a Colossus; and we petty men
CASCA	Walk under his huge legs, and peep about
CASCA	To find ourselves dishonourable graves.
CASCA	Men at some time are masters of their fates:
CASCA	The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,
CASCA	But in ourselves, that we are underlings.
CASCA	Brutus and Cæsar: what should be in that 'Cæsar?'
CASCA	Why should that name be sounded more than yours?
CASCA	Write them together, yours is as fair a name;
CASCA	Sound them, it doth become the mouth as well;
CASCA	Weigh them, it is as heavy; conjure with 'em,
CASCA	'Brutus' will start a spirit as soon as 'Cæsar.'
CASCA	Now, in the names of all the gods at once,
CASCA	Upon what meat doth this our Cæsar feed,
CASCA	That he is grown so great? Age, thou art sham'd!
CASCA	Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods!
CASCA	When went there by an age, since the great flood,
CASCA	But it was fam'd with more than with one man?
CASCA	When could they say, till now, that talk'd of Rome,
CASCA	That her wide walls encompass'd but one man?
CASCA	Now is it Rome indeed and room enough,
CASCA	When there is in it but one only man.
CASCA	O! you and I have heard our fathers say,
CASCA	There was a Brutus once that would have brook'd
CASCA	Th' eternal devil to keep his state in Rome
CASCA	As easily as a king.
CASCA	I am glad
CASCA	That my weak words have struck but thus much show
CASCA	Of fire from Brutus.
CASCA	As they pass by, pluck Casca by the sleeve,
CASCA	And he will, after his sour fashion, tell you
CASCA	What hath proceeded worthy note to-day.
CASCA	Casca will tell us what the matter is.
CASCA	You pull'd me by the cloak; would you speak with me?
CASCA	Why, you were with him, were you not?
CASCA	Why, there was a crown offered him; and, being offered him, he put it by with the back of his hand, thus; and then the people fell a-shouting.
CASCA	Why, for that too.
CASCA	They shouted thrice: what was the last cry for?
CASCA	Why, for that too.
CASCA	Ay, marry, was 't, and he put it by thrice, everytime gentler than other; and at every putting-by mine honest neighbours shouted.
CASCA	Who offered him the crown?
CASCA	Why, Antony.
CASCA	I can as well be hanged as tell the manner of it: it was mere foolery; I did not mark it. I saw Mark Antony offer him a crown; yet 'twas not a crown neither, 'twas one of these coronets; and, as I told you, he put it by once; but, for all that, to my thinking, he would fain have had it. Then he offered it to him again; then he put it by again; but, to my thinking, he was very loath to lay his fingers off it. And then he offered it the third time; he put it the third time by; and still as he refused it the rabblement shouted and clapped their chopped hands, and threw up their sweaty night-caps, and uttered such a deal of stinking breath because Cæsar refused the crown, that it had almost choked Cæsar; for he swounded and fell down at it: and for mine own part, I durst not laugh, for fear of opening my lips and receiving the bad air.
CASCA	But soft, I pray you: what! did Cæsar swound?
CASCA	He fell down in the market-place, and foamed at mouth, and was speechless.
CASCA	No, Cæsar hath it not; but you, and I, And honest Casca, we have the falling-sickness.
CASCA	I know not what you mean by that; but I am sure Cæsar fell down. If the tag-rag people did not clap him and hiss him, according as he pleased and displeased them, as they use to do the players in the theatre, I am no true man.
CASCA	Marry, before he fell down, when he perceiv'd the common herd was glad he refused the crown, he plucked me ope his doublet and offered them his throat to cut. An I had been a man of any occupation, if I would not have taken him at a word, I would I might go to hell among the rogues. And so he fell. When he came to himself again, he said, if he had done or said any thing amiss, he desired their worships to think it was his infirmity. Three or four wenches, where I stood, cried, 'Alas! good soul,' and forgave him with all their hearts: but there's no head to be taken of them; if Cæsar had stabbed their mothers, they would have done no less.
CASCA	Ay.
CASCA	Did Cicero say any thing?
CASCA	Ay, he spoke Greek.
CASCA	To what effect?
CASCA	Nay, an I tell you that, I'll ne'er look you i' the face again; but those that understood him smiled at one another and shook their heads; but, for mine own part, it was Greek to me. I could tell you more news too; Marullus and Flavius, for pulling scarfs off Cæsar's images, are put to silence. Fare you well. There was more foolery yet, if I could remember it.
CASCA	Will you sup with me to-night, Casca?
CASCA	No, I am promised forth.
CASCA	Will you dine with me to-morrow?
CASCA	Ay, if I be alive, and your mind hold, and your dinner worth the eating.
CASCA	Good; I will expect you.
CASCA	Do so. Farewell, both.
CASCA	So is he now in execution
CASCA	Of any bold or noble enterprise,
CASCA	However he puts on this tardy form.
CASCA	This rudeness is a sauce to his good wit,
CASCA	Which gives men stomach to digest his words
CASCA	With better appetite.
CASCA	I will do so: till then, think of the world.
CASCA	Well, Brutus, thou art noble; yet, I see,
CASCA	Thy honourable metal may be wrought
CASCA	From that it is dispos'd: therefore 'tis meet
CASCA	That noble minds keep ever with their likes;
CASCA	For who so firm that cannot be seduc'd?
CASCA	Cæsar doth bear me hard; but he loves Brutus:
CASCA	If I were Brutus now and he were Cassius
CASCA	He should not humour me. I will this night,
CASCA	In several hands, in at his windows throw,
CASCA	As if they came from several citizens,
CASCA	Writings all tending to the great opinion
CASCA	That Rome holds of his name; wherein obscurely
CASCA	Cæsar's ambition shall be glanced at:
CASCA	And after this let Cæsar seat him sure;
CASCA	For we will shake him, or worse days endure.
CASCA	Are not you mov'd, when all the sway of earth
CASCA	Shakes like a thing unfirm? O Cicero!
CASCA	I have seen tempests, when the scolding winds
CASCA	Have riv'd the knotty oaks; and I have seen
CASCA	The ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam,
CASCA	To be exalted with the threat'ning clouds:
CASCA	But never till to-night, never till now,
CASCA	Did I go through a tempest dropping fire.
CASCA	Either there is a civil strife in heaven,
CASCA	Or else the world, too saucy with the gods,
CASCA	Incenses them to send destruction.
CASCA	A common slave—you know him well by sight—
CASCA	Held up his left hand, which did flame and burn
CASCA	Like twenty torches join'd; and yet his hand,
CASCA	Not sensible of fire, remain'd unscorch'd.
CASCA	Besides,—I have not since put up my sword,—
CASCA	Against the Capitol I met a hon,
CASCA	Who glar'd upon me, and went surly by,
CASCA	Without annoying me; and there were drawn
CASCA	Upon a heap a hundred ghastly women,
CASCA	Transformed with their fear, who swore they saw
CASCA	Men all in fire walk up and down the streets.
CASCA	And yesterday the bird of night did sit,
CASCA	Even at noon-day, upon the market-place,
CASCA	Hooting and shrieking. When these prodigies
CASCA	Do so conjointly meet, let not men say
CASCA	'These are their reasons, they are natural;'
CASCA	For, I believe, they are portentous things
CASCA	Unto the climate that they point upon.
CASCA	He doth; for he did bid Antonius
CASCA	Send word to you he would be there to-morrow.
CASCA	Farewell, Cicero.
CASCA	Who's there?
CASCA	A Roman.
CASCA	Casca, by your voice.
CASCA	Your ear is good. Cassius, what night is this!
CASCA	A very pleasing night to honest men.
CASCA	Who ever knew the heavens menace so?
CASCA	Those that have known the earth so full of faults.
CASCA	For my part, I have walk'd about the streets,
CASCA	Submitting me unto the perilous night,
CASCA	And, thus unbraced, Casca, as you see,
CASCA	Have bar'd my bosom to the thunder-stone;
CASCA	And, when the cross blue lightning seem'd to open
CASCA	The breast of heaven, I did present myself
CASCA	Even in the aim and very flash of it.
CASCA	But wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens?
CASCA	It is the part of men to fear and tremble
CASCA	When the most mighty gods by tokens send
CASCA	Such dreadful heralds to astonish us.
CASCA	You are dull, Casca, and those sparks of life
CASCA	That should be in a Roman you do want,
CASCA	Or else you use not. You look pale, and gaze,
CASCA	And put on fear, and cast yourself in wonder,
CASCA	To see the strange impatience of the heavens;
CASCA	But if you would consider the true cause
CASCA	Why all these fires, why all these gliding ghosts,
CASCA	Why birds and beasts, from quality and kind;
CASCA	Why old men, fools, and children calculate;
CASCA	Why all these things change from their ordinance,
CASCA	Their natures, and pre-formed faculties,
CASCA	To monstrous quality, why, you shall find
CASCA	That heaven hath infus'd them with these spirits
CASCA	To make them instruments of fear and warning
CASCA	Unto some monstrous state.
CASCA	Now could I, Casca, name to thee a man
CASCA	Most like this dreadful night,
CASCA	That thunders, lightens, opens graves, and roars
CASCA	As doth the lion in the Capitol,
CASCA	A man no mightier than thyself or me
CASCA	In personal action, yet prodigious grown
CASCA	And fearful as these strange eruptions are.
CASCA	'Tis Cæsar that you mean; is it not, Cassius?
CASCA	Let it be who it is: for Romans now
CASCA	Have thews and limbs like to their ancestors;
CASCA	But, woe the while! our fathers' minds are dead,
CASCA	And we are govern'd with our mothers' spirits;
CASCA	Our yoke and sufferance show us womanish.
CASCA	Indeed, they say the senators to-morrow
CASCA	Mean to establish Cæsar as a king;
CASCA	And he shall wear his crown by sea and land,
CASCA	In every place, save here in Italy.
CASCA	I know where I will wear this dagger then;
CASCA	Cassius from bondage will deliver Cassius:
CASCA	Therein, ye gods, you make the weak most strong;
CASCA	Therein, ye gods, you tyrants do defeat:
CASCA	Nor stony tower, nor walls of beaten brass,
CASCA	Nor airless dungeon, nor strong links of iron,
CASCA	Can be retentive to the strength of spirit;
CASCA	But life, being weary of those worldly bars,
CASCA	Never lacks power to dismiss itself.
CASCA	If I know this, know all the world besides,
CASCA	That part of tyranny that I do bear
CASCA	I can shake off at pleasure.
CASCA	So can I:
CASCA	So every bondman in his own hand bears
CASCA	The power to cancel his captivity.
CASCA	And why should Cæsar be a tyrant then?
CASCA	Poor man! I know he would not be a wolf
CASCA	But that he sees the Romans are but sheep;
CASCA	He were no lion were not Romans hinds.
CASCA	Those that with haste will make a mighty fire
CASCA	Begin it with weak straws; what trash is Rome,
CASCA	What rubbish, and what offal, when it serves
CASCA	For the base matter to illuminate
CASCA	So vile a thing as Cæsar! But, O grief!
CASCA	Where hast thou led me? I, perhaps, speak this
CASCA	Before a willing bondman; then I know
CASCA	My answer must be made: but I am arm'd,
CASCA	And dangers are to me indifferent.
CASCA	You speak to Casca, and to such a man
CASCA	That is no fleering tell-tale. Hold, my hand:
CASCA	Be factious for redress of all these griefs,
CASCA	And I will set this foot of mine as far
CASCA	As who goes furthest.
CASCA	There's a bargain made.
CASCA	Now know you, Casca, I have mov'd already
CASCA	Some certain of the noblest-minded Romans
CASCA	To undergo with me an enterprise
CASCA	Of honourable-dangerous consequence;
CASCA	And I do know by this they stay for me
CASCA	In Pompey's porch: for now, this fearful night,
CASCA	There is no stir, or walking in the streets;
CASCA	And the complexion of the element
CASCA	In favour's like the work we have in hand,
CASCA	Most bloody, fiery, and most terrible.
CASCA	Stand close awhile, for here comes one in haste.
CASCA	'Tis Cinna; I do know him by his gait:
CASCA	He is a friend.
CASCA	Cinna, where haste you so?
CASCA	No, it is Casca; one incorporate
CASCA	To our attempts. Am I not stay'd for, Cinna?
CASCA	Am I not stay'd for? Tell me.
CASCA	Be you content. Good Cinna, take this paper,
CASCA	And look you lay it in the prætor's chair,
CASCA	Where Brutus may but find it; and throw this
CASCA	In at his window; set this up with wax
CASCA	Upon old Brutus' statue: all this done,
CASCA	Repair to Pompey's porch, where you shall find us.
CASCA	Is Decius Brutus and Trebonius there?
CASCA	That done, repair to Pompey's theatre.
CASCA	Come, Casca, you and I will yet ere day
CASCA	See Brutus at his house: three parts of him
CASCA	Is ours already, and the man entire
CASCA	Upon the next encounter yields him ours.
CASCA	O! he sits high in all the people's hearts:
CASCA	And that which would appear offence in us,
CASCA	His countenance, like richest alchemy,
CASCA	Will change to virtue and to worthiness.
CASCA	Him and his worth and our great need of him
CASCA	You have right well conceited. Let us go,
CASCA	For it is after midnight; and ere day
CASCA	We will awake him and be sure of him.
CASCA	I think we are too bold upon your rest:
CASCA	Good morrow, Brutus; do we trouble you?
CASCA	Yes, every man of them; and no man here
CASCA	But honours you; and every one doth wish
CASCA	You had but that opinion of yourself
CASCA	Which every noble Roman bears of you.
CASCA	This is Trebonius.
CASCA	This, Decius Brutus.
CASCA	This, Casca; this, Cinna;
CASCA	And this, Metellus Cimber.
CASCA	Shall I entreat a word?
CASCA	No.
CASCA	You shall confess that you are both deceiv'd.
CASCA	Here, as I point my sword, the sun arises;
CASCA	Which is a great way growing on the south,
CASCA	Weighing the youthful season of the year.
CASCA	Some two months hence up higher toward the north
CASCA	He first presents his fire; and the high east
CASCA	Stands, as the Capitol, directly here.
CASCA	And let us swear our resolution.
CASCA	But what of Cicero? Shall we sound him?
CASCA	I think he will stand very strong with us.
CASCA	Let us not leave him out.
CASCA	Then leave him out.
CASCA	Indeed he is not fit.
CASCA	Decius, well urg'd. I think it is not meet,
CASCA	Mark Antony, so well belov'd of Cæsar,
CASCA	Should outlive Cæsar: we shall find of him
CASCA	A shrewd contriver; and, you know, his means,
CASCA	If he improve them, may well stretch so far
CASCA	As to annoy us all; which to prevent,
CASCA	Let Antony and Cæsar fall together.
CASCA	Yet I fear him;
CASCA	For in the engrafted love he bears to Cæsar—
CASCA	The clock hath stricken three.
CASCA	But it is doubtful yet
CASCA	Whether Cæsar will come forth to-day or no;
CASCA	For he is superstitious grown of late,
CASCA	Quite from the main opinion he held once
CASCA	Of fantasy, of dreams, and ceremonies.
CASCA	It may be, these apparent prodigies,
CASCA	The unaccustom'd terror of this night,
CASCA	And the persuasion of his augurers,
CASCA	May hold him from the Capitol to-day.
CASCA	Nay, we will all of us be there to fetch him.
CASCA	The morning comes upon 's: we'll leave you, Brutus.
CASCA	And, friends, disperse yourselves; but all remember
CASCA	What you have said, and show yourselves true Romans.
CASCA	What enterprise, Popilius?
CASCA	He wish'd to-day our enterprise might thrive.
CASCA	I fear our purpose is discovered.
CASCA	Casca, be sudden, for we fear prevention.
CASCA	Brutus, what shall be done? If this be known,
CASCA	Cassius or Cæsar never shall turn back,
CASCA	For I will slay myself.
CASCA	Trebonius knows his time; for, look you, Brutus,
CASCA	He draws Mark Antony out of the way.
CASCA	Are we all ready? What is now amiss,
CASCA	That Cæsar and his senate must redress?
CASCA	Pardon, Cæsar; Cæsar, pardon:
CASCA	As low as to thy foot doth Cassius fall,
CASCA	To beg enfranchisement for Publius Cimber.
CASCA	Speak, hands, for me!
CASCA	Some to the common pulpits, and cry out,
CASCA	'Liberty, freedom, and enfranchisement!'
CASCA	Go to the pulpit, Brutus.
CASCA	And leave us, Publius; lest that the people,
CASCA	Rushing on us, should do your age some mischief.
CASCA	Where's Antony?
CASCA	Why, he that cuts off twenty years of life
CASCA	Cuts off so many years of fearing death.
CASCA	Stoop, then, and wash. How many ages hence
CASCA	Shall this our lofty scene be acted o'er,
CASCA	In states unborn and accents yet unknown!
CASCA	So oft as that shall be,
CASCA	So often shall the knot of us be call'd
CASCA	The men that gave their country liberty.
CASCA	Ay, every man away:
CASCA	Brutus shall lead; and we will grace his heels
CASCA	With the most boldest and best hearts of Rome.
CASCA	I wish we may: but yet have I a mind
CASCA	That fears him much; and my misgiving still
CASCA	Falls shrewdly to the purpose.
CASCA	Your voice shall be as strong as any man's
CASCA	In the disposing of new dignities.
CASCA	Mark Antony,—
CASCA	I blame you not for praising Cæsar so;
CASCA	But what compact mean you to have with us?
CASCA	Will you be prick'd in number of our friends,
CASCA	Or shall we on, and not depend on you?
CASCA	Brutus, a word with you.
CASCA	You know not what you do; do not consent
CASCA	That Antony speak in his funeral:
CASCA	Know you how much the people may be mov'd
CASCA	By that which he will utter?
CASCA	I know not what may fall; I like it not.
CASCA	Stand, ho!
CASCA	Most noble brother, you have done me wrong.
CASCA	Brutus, this sober form of yours hides wrongs;
CASCA	And when you do them—
CASCA	Pindarus,
CASCA	Bid our commanders lead their charges off
CASCA	A little from this ground.
CASCA	That you have wrong'd me doth appear in this:
CASCA	You have condemn'd and noted Lucius Pella
CASCA	For taking bribes here of the Sardians;
CASCA	Wherein my letters, praying on his side,
CASCA	Because I knew the man, were slighted off.
CASCA	In such a time as this it is not meet
CASCA	That every nice offence should bear his comment.
CASCA	I an itching palm!
CASCA	You know that you are Brutus that speak this,
CASCA	Or, by the gods, this speech were else your last.
CASCA	Chastisement!
CASCA	Brutus, bay not me;
CASCA	I'll not endure it: you forget yourself,
CASCA	To hedge me in. I am a soldier, I,
CASCA	Older in practice, abler than yourself
CASCA	To make conditions.
CASCA	I am.
CASCA	Urge me no more, I shall forget myself;
CASCA	Have mind upon your health; tempt me no further.
CASCA	Is 't possible?
CASCA	O ye gods! ye gods! Must I endure all this?
CASCA	Is it come to this?
CASCA	You wrong me every way; you wrong me, Brutus;
CASCA	I said an elder soldier, not a better:
CASCA	Did I say, 'better?'
CASCA	When Cæsar liv'd, he durst not thus have mov'd me.
CASCA	I durst not!
CASCA	What! durst not tempt him!
CASCA	Do not presume too much upon my love;
CASCA	I may do that I shall be sorry for.
CASCA	I denied you not.
CASCA	I did not: he was but a fool
CASCA	That brought my answer back. Brutus hath riv'd my heart.
CASCA	A friend should bear his friend's infirmities,
CASCA	But Brutus makes mine greater than they are.
CASCA	You love me not.
CASCA	A friendly eye could never see such faults.
CASCA	Come, Antony, and young Octavius, come,
CASCA	Revenge yourselves alone on Cassius,
CASCA	For Cassius is aweary of the world;
CASCA	Hated by one he loves; brav'd by his brother;
CASCA	Check'd like a bondman; all his faults observ'd,
CASCA	Set in a note-book, learn'd, and conn'd by rote,
CASCA	To cast into my teeth. O! I could weep
CASCA	My spirit from mine eyes. There is my dagger,
CASCA	And here my naked breast; within, a heart
CASCA	Dearer than Plutus' mine, richer than gold:
CASCA	If that thou be'st a Roman, take it forth;
CASCA	I, that denied thee gold, will give my heart:
CASCA	Strike, as thou didst at Cæsar; for, I know,
CASCA	When thou didst hate him worst, thou lov'dst him better
CASCA	Than ever thou lov'dst Cassius.
CASCA	Hath Cassius liv'd
CASCA	To be but mirth and laughter to his Brutus,
CASCA	When grief and blood ill-temper'd vexeth him?
CASCA	Do you confess so much? Give me your hand.
CASCA	O Brutus!
CASCA	Have not you love enough to bear with me,
CASCA	When that rash humour which my mother gave me
CASCA	Makes me forgetful?
CASCA	How now! What's the matter?
CASCA	Ha, ha! how vilely doth this cynic rime!
CASCA	Bear with him, Brutus; 'tis his fashion.
CASCA	Away, away! be gone.
CASCA	And come yourselves, and bring Messala with you,
CASCA	Immediately to us.
CASCA	I did not think you could have been so angry.
CASCA	Of your philosophy you make no use
CASCA	If you give place to accidental evils.
CASCA	Ha! Portia!
CASCA	How 'scap'd I killing when I cross'd you so?
CASCA	O insupportable and touching loss!
CASCA	Upon what sickness?
CASCA	And died so?
CASCA	O ye immortal gods!
CASCA	My heart is thirsty for that noble pledge.
CASCA	Fill, Lucius, till the wine o'erswell the cup;
CASCA	I cannot drink too much of Brutus' love.
CASCA	Portia, art thou gone?
CASCA	Cicero one!
CASCA	I have as much of this in art as you,
CASCA	But yet my nature could not bear it so.
CASCA	I do not think it good.
CASCA	This is it:
CASCA	'Tis better that the enemy seek us:
CASCA	So shall he waste his means, weary his soldiers,
CASCA	Doing himself offence; whilst we, lying still,
CASCA	Are full of rest, defence, and nimbleness.
CASCA	Hear me, good brother.
CASCA	Then, with your will, go on;
CASCA	We'll along ourselves, and meet them at Philippi.
CASCA	No more. Good-night:
CASCA	Early to-morrow will we rise, and hence.
CASCA	O my dear brother!
CASCA	This was an ill beginning of the night:
CASCA	Never come such division 'tween our souls!
CASCA	Let it not, Brutus.
CASCA	Good-night, my lord.
CASCA	Stand fast, Titinius: we must out and talk.
CASCA	Antony,
CASCA	The posture of your blows are yet unknown;
CASCA	But for your words, they rob the Hybla bees,
CASCA	And leave them honeyless.
CASCA	Flatterers! Now, Brutus, thank yourself:
CASCA	This tongue had not offended so to-day,
CASCA	If Cassius might have rul'd.
CASCA	A peevish schoolboy, worthless of such honour,
CASCA	Join'd with a masquer and a reveller.
CASCA	Why now, blow wind, swell billow, and swim bark!
CASCA	The storm is up, and all is on the hazard.
CASCA	Messala!
CASCA	Messala,
CASCA	This is my birth-day; as this very day
CASCA	Was Cassius born. Give me thy hand, Messala:
CASCA	Be thou my witness that against my will,
CASCA	As Pompey was, am I compell'd to set
CASCA	Upon one battle all our liberties.
CASCA	You know that I held Epicurus strong,
CASCA	And his opinion; now I change my mind,
CASCA	And partly credit things that do presage.
CASCA	Coming from Sardis, on our former ensign
CASCA	Two mighty eagles fell, and there they perch'd,
CASCA	Gorging and feeding from our soldiers' hands;
CASCA	Who to Philippi here consorted us:
CASCA	This morning are they fled away and gone,
CASCA	And in their stead do ravens, crows, and kites
CASCA	Fly o'er our heads, and downward look on us,
CASCA	As we were sickly prey: their shadows seem
CASCA	A canopy most fatal, under which
CASCA	Our army lies, ready to give up the ghost.
CASCA	I but believe it partly,
CASCA	For I am fresh of spirit and resolv'd
CASCA	To meet all perils very constantly.
CASCA	Now, most noble Brutus,
CASCA	The gods to-day stand friendly, that we may,
CASCA	Lovers in peace, lead on our days to age!
CASCA	But since the affairs of men rest still incertain,
CASCA	Let's reason with the worst that may befall.
CASCA	If we do lose this battle, then is this
CASCA	The very last time we shall speak together:
CASCA	What are you then, determined to do?
CASCA	Then, if we lose this battle,
CASCA	You are contented to be led in triumph
CASCA	Thorough the streets of Rome?
CASCA	For ever, and for ever, farewell, Brutus!
CASCA	If we do meet again, we'll smile indeed;
CASCA	If not, 'tis true this parting was well made.
CASCA	O! look, Titinius, look, the villains fly:
CASCA	Myself have to mine own turn'd enemy;
CASCA	This ensign here of mine was turning back;
CASCA	I slew the coward, and did take it from him.
CASCA	This hill is far enough. Look, look, Titinius;
CASCA	Are those my tents where I perceive the fire?
CASCA	Titinius, if thou lov'st me,
CASCA	Mount thou my horse, and hide thy spurs in him,
CASCA	Till he have brought thee up to yonder troops
CASCA	And here again; that I may rest assur'd
CASCA	Whether yond troops are friend or enemy.
CASCA	Go, Pindarus, get higher on that hill;
CASCA	My sight was ever thick; regard Titinius,
CASCA	And tell me what thou not'st about the field.
CASCA	This day I breathed first; time is come round,
CASCA	And where I did begin, there shall I end;
CASCA	My life is run his compass. Sirrah, what news?
CASCA	What news?
CASCA	Come down; behold no more.
CASCA	O, coward that I am, to live so long,
CASCA	To see my best friend ta'en before my face!
CASCA	Come hither, sirrah:
CASCA	In Parthia did I take thee prisoner;
CASCA	And then I swore thee, saving of thy life,
CASCA	That whatsoever I did bid thee do,
CASCA	Thou shouldst attempt it. Come now, keep thine oath;
CASCA	Now be a freeman; and with this good sword,
CASCA	That ran through Cæsar's bowels, search this bosom.
CASCA	Stand not to answer; here, take thou the hilts;
CASCA	And, when my face is cover'd, as 'tis now,
CASCA	Guide thou the sword. Cæsar, thou art reveng'd,
CASCA	Even with the sword that kill'd thee.
CESAR	Calphurnia!
CESAR	Calphurnia!
CESAR	Stand you directly in Antonius' way
CESAR	When he doth run his course. Antonius!
CESAR	Forget not, in your speed, Antonius,
CESAR	To touch Calphurnia; for our elders say,
CESAR	The barren, touched in this holy chase,
CESAR	Shake off their sterile curse.
CESAR	Set on; and leave no ceremony out.
CESAR	Ha! Who calls?
CESAR	Who is it in the press that calls on me?
CESAR	I hear a tongue, shriller than all the music,
CESAR	Cry 'Cæsar.' Speak; Cæsar is turn'd to hear.
CESAR	What man is that?
CESAR	Set him before me; let me see his face.
CESAR	What sayst thou to me now? Speak once again.
CESAR	He is a dreamer; let us leave him: pass.
CESAR	Antonius!
CESAR	Let me have men about me that are fat;
CESAR	Sleek-headed men and such as sleep o' nights.
CESAR	Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look;
CESAR	He thinks too much: such men are dangerous:
CESAR	Would he were fatter! but I fear him not:
CESAR	Yet if my name were liable to fear,
CESAR	I do not know the man I should avoid
CESAR	So soon as that spare Cassius. He reads much;
CESAR	He is a great observer, and he looks
CESAR	Quite through the deeds of men; he loves no plays,
CESAR	As thou dost, Antony; he hears no music;
CESAR	Seldom he smiles, and smiles in such a sort
CESAR	As if he mock'd himself, and scorn'd his spirit
CESAR	That could be mov'd to smile at any thing.
CESAR	Such men as he be never at heart's ease
CESAR	Whiles they behold a greater than themselves,
CESAR	And therefore are they very dangerous.
CESAR	I rather tell thee what is to be fear'd
CESAR	Than what I fear, for always I am Cæsar.
CESAR	Come on my right hand, for this ear is deaf,
CESAR	And tell me truly what thou think'st of him.
CESAR	Nor heaven nor earth have been at peace to-night:
CESAR	Thrice hath Calphurnia in her sleep cried out,
CESAR	'Help, ho! They murder Cæsar!' Who's within?
CESAR	Go bid the priests do present sacrifice,
CESAR	And bring me their opinions of success.
CESAR	Cæsar shall forth: the things that threaten'd me
CESAR	Ne'er look'd but on my back; when they shall see
CESAR	The face of Cæsar, they are vanished.
CESAR	What can be avoided
CESAR	Whose end is purpos'd by the mighty gods?
CESAR	Yet Cæsar shall go forth; for these predictions
CESAR	Are to the world in general as to Cæsar.
CESAR	Cowards die many times before their deaths;
CESAR	The valiant never taste of death but once.
CESAR	Of all the wonders that I yet have heard,
CESAR	It seems to me most strange that men should fear;
CESAR	Seeing that death, a necessary end,
CESAR	Will come when it will come.
CESAR	What say the augurers?
CESAR	The gods do this in shame of cowardice:
CESAR	Cæsar should be a beast without a heart
CESAR	If he should stay at home to-day for fear.
CESAR	No, Cæsar shall not; danger knows full well
CESAR	That Cæsar is more dangerous than he:
CESAR	We are two lions litter'd in one day,
CESAR	And I the elder and more terrible:
CESAR	And Cæsar shall go forth.
CESAR	Mark Antony shall say I am not well;
CESAR	And, for thy humour, I will stay at home.
CESAR	Here's Decius Brutus, he shall tell them so.
CESAR	And you are come in very happy time
CESAR	To bear my greeting to the senators,
CESAR	And tell them that I will not come to-day:
CESAR	Cannot, is false, and that I dare not, falser;
CESAR	I will not come to-day: tell them so, Decius.
CESAR	Shall Cæsar send a lie?
CESAR	Have I in conquest stretch'd mine arm so far
CESAR	To be afeard to tell greybeards the truth?
CESAR	Decius, go tell them Cæsar will not come.
CESAR	The cause is in my will: I will not come;
CESAR	That is enough to satisfy the senate:
CESAR	But for your private satisfaction,
CESAR	Because I love you, I will let you know:
CESAR	Calphurnia here, my wife, stays me at home:
CESAR	She dreamt to-night she saw my statua,
CESAR	Which, like a fountain with a hundred spouts,
CESAR	Did run pure blood; and many lusty Romans
CESAR	Came smiling, and did bathe their hands in it:
CESAR	And these does she apply for warnings and portents,
CESAR	And evils imminent; and on her knee
CESAR	Hath begg'd that I will stay at home to-day.
CESAR	And this way have you well expounded it.
CESAR	How foolish do your fears seem now, Calphurnia!
CESAR	I am ashamed I did yield to them.
CESAR	Give me my robe, for I will go:
CESAR	And look where Publius is come to fetch me.
CESAR	Welcome, Publius.
CESAR	What! Brutus, are you stirr'd so early too?
CESAR	Good morrow, Casca. Caius Ligarius,
CESAR	Cæsar was ne'er so much your enemy
CESAR	As that same ague which hath made you lean.
CESAR	What is't o'clock?
CESAR	I thank you for your pains and courtesy.
CESAR	See! Antony, that revels long o' nights,
CESAR	Is notwithstanding up. Good morrow, Antony.
CESAR	Bid them prepare within:
CESAR	I am to blame to be thus waited for.
CESAR	Now, Cinna; now, Metellus; what, Trebonius!
CESAR	I have an hour's talk in store for you;
CESAR	Remember that you call on me to-day:
CESAR	Be near me, that I may remember you.
CESAR	Good friends, go in, and taste some wine with me;
CESAR	And we, like friends, will straightway go together.
CESAR	The idea of March are come.
CESAR	What touches us ourself shall be last serv'd
CESAR	What! is the fellow mad?
CESAR	What! urge you your petitions in the street?
CESAR	Come to the Capitol.
CESAR	I must prevent thee, Cimber.
CESAR	These couchings and these lowly courtesies,
CESAR	Might fire the blood of ordinary men,
CESAR	And turn pre-ordinance and first decree
CESAR	Into the law of children. Be not fond,
CESAR	To think that Cæsar bears such rebel blood
CESAR	That will be thaw'd from the true quality
CESAR	With that which melteth fools; I mean sweet words,
CESAR	Low-crooked curtsies, and base spaniel fawning.
CESAR	Thy brother by decree is banished:
CESAR	If thou dost bend and pray and fawn for him,
CESAR	I spurn thee like a cur out of my way.
CESAR	Know, Cæsar doth not wrong, nor without cause
CESAR	Will he be satisfied.
CESAR	What, Brutus!
CESAR	I could be well mov'd if I were as you;
CESAR	If I could pray to move, prayers would move me;
CESAR	But I am constant as the northern star,
CESAR	Of whose true-fix'd and resting quality
CESAR	There is no fellow in the firmament.
CESAR	The skies are painted with unnumber'd sparks,
CESAR	They are all fire and every one doth shine,
CESAR	But there's but one in all doth hold his place:
CESAR	So, in the world; 'tis furnish'd well with men,
CESAR	And men are flesh and blood, and apprehensive;
CESAR	Yet in the number I do know but one
CESAR	That unassailable holds on his rank,
CESAR	Unshak'd of motion: and that I am he,
CESAR	Let me a little show it, even in this,
CESAR	That I was constant Cimber should be banish'd,
CESAR	And constant do remain to keep him so.
CESAR	Hence! Wilt thou lift up Olympus!
CESAR	Doth not Brutus bootless kneel?
CESAR	Et tu, Brute? Then fall, Cæsar!
CLOWN 1	Is she to be buried in Christian burial that wilfully seeks her own salvation?
CLOWN 1	How can that be, unless she drowned herself in her own defence?
CLOWN 1	It must be se offendendo; it cannot be else. For here lies the point: if I drown myself wittingly it argues an act; and an act hath three branches; it is, to act, to do, and to perform: argal, she drowned herself wittingly.
CLOWN 1	Give me leave. Here lies the water; good: here stands the man; good: if the man go to this water, and drown himself, it is, will he, nill he, he goes; mark you that? but if the water come to him, and drown him, he drowns not himself: argal, he that is not guilty of his own death shortens not his own life.
CLOWN 1	Ay, marry, is 't; crowner's quest law.
CLOWN 1	Why, there thou sayest; and the more pity that great folk should have countenance in this world to drown or hang themselves more than their even Christian. Come, my spade. There is no ancient gentlemen but gardeners, ditchers, and grave-makers; they hold up Adam's profession.
CLOWN 1	A' was the first that ever bore arms.
CLOWN 1	What! art a heathen? How dost thou understand the Scripture? The Scripture says, Adam digged; could be dig without arms?
CLOWN 1	I'll put another question to thee; if thou answerest me not to the purpose, confess thyself—
CLOWN 1	What is he that builds stronger than either the mason, the shipwright, or the carpenter?
CLOWN 1	I like thy wit well, in good faith; the gallows does well, but how does it well? it does well to those that do ill; now thou dost ill to say the gallows is built stronger than the church: argal, the gallows may do well to thee.
CLOWN 1	To 't again; come.
CLOWN 1	Ay, tell me that, and unyoke.
CLOWN 1	To 't.
CLOWN 1	Cudgel thy brains no more about it, for your dull ass will not mend his pace with beating; and, when you are asked this question next, say, 'a grave-maker:' the houses that he makes last till doomsday. Go, get thee to Yaughan; fetch me a stoup of liquor.
CLOWN 1	First Clown digs, and sings.
CLOWN 1	In youth, when I did love, did love,
CLOWN 1	Methought it was very sweet,
CLOWN 1	To contract, O! the time, for-a my behove,
CLOWN 1	O! methought there was nothing meet.
CLOWN 1	But age, with his stealing steps,
CLOWN 1	Hath claw'd me in his clutch,
CLOWN 1	And hath shipped me intil the land,
CLOWN 1	As if I had never been such.
CLOWN 1	A pick-axe, and a spade, a spade,
CLOWN 1	For and a shrouding sheet;
CLOWN 1	O! a pit of clay for to be made
CLOWN 1	For such a guest is meet.
CLOWN 1	Mine, sir,
CLOWN 1	O! a pit of clay for to be made
CLOWN 1	For such a guest is meet.
CLOWN 1	You lie out on 't, sir, and therefore it is not yours; for my part, I do not lie in 't, and yet it is mine.
CLOWN 1	'Tis a quick lie, sir; 'twill away again, from me to you.
CLOWN 1	For no man, sir.
CLOWN 1	For none, neither.
CLOWN 1	One that was a woman, sir; but, rest her soul, she's dead.
CLOWN 1	Of all the days i' the year, I came to 't that day that our last King Hamlet overcame Fortinbras.
CLOWN 1	Cannot you tell that? every fool can tell that; it was the very day that young Hamlet was born; he that is mad, and sent into England.
CLOWN 1	Why, because he was mad: he shall recover his wits there; or, if he do not, 'tis no great matter there
CLOWN 1	'Twill not be seen in him there; there the men are as mad as he.
CLOWN 1	Very strangely, they say.
CLOWN 1	Faith, e'en with losing his wits.
CLOWN 1	Why, here in Denmark; I have been sexton here, man and boy, thirty years.
CLOWN 1	Faith, if he be not rotten before he die,—as we have many pocky corses now-a-days, that will scarce hold the laying in,—he will last you some eight year or nine year; a tanner will last you nine year.
CLOWN 1	Why, sir, his hide is so tanned with his trade that he will keep out water a great while, and your water is a sore decayer of your whoreson dead body. Here's a skull now; this skull hath lain you i' the earth three-and-twenty years.
CLOWN 1	A whoreson mad fellow's it was: whose do you think it was?
CLOWN 1	A pestilence on him for a mad rogue! a' poured a flagon of Rhenish on my head once. This same skull, sir, was Yorick's skull, the king's jester.
CLOWN 1	E'en that.
DUNCAN	What bloody man is that? He can report,
DUNCAN	As seemeth by his plight, of the revolt
DUNCAN	The newest state.
DUNCAN	O valiant cousin! worthy gentleman!
DUNCAN	Dismay'd not this
DUNCAN	Our captains, Macbeth and Banquo?
DUNCAN	So well thy words become thee as thy wounds;
DUNCAN	They smack of honour both. Go, get him surgeons.
DUNCAN	Who comes here?
DUNCAN	Whence cam'st thou, worthy thane?
DUNCAN	Great happiness!
DUNCAN	No more that Thane of Cawdor shall deceive
DUNCAN	Our bosom interest. Go pronounce his present death,
DUNCAN	And with his former title greet Macbeth.
DUNCAN	What he hath lost noble Macbeth hath won.
DUNCAN	Is execution done on Cawdor? Are not
DUNCAN	Those in commission yet return'd?
DUNCAN	There's no art
DUNCAN	To find the mind's construction in the face:
DUNCAN	He was a gentleman on whom I built
DUNCAN	An absolute trust.
DUNCAN	O worthiest cousin!
DUNCAN	The sin of my ingratitude even now
DUNCAN	Was heavy on me. Thou art so far before
DUNCAN	That swiftest wing of recompense is slow
DUNCAN	To overtake thee; would thou hadst less deserv'd,
DUNCAN	That the proportion both of thanks and payment
DUNCAN	Might have been mine! only I have left to say,
DUNCAN	More is thy due than more than all can pay.
DUNCAN	Welcome hither:
DUNCAN	I have begun to plant thee, and will labour
DUNCAN	To make thee full of growing. Noble Banquo,
DUNCAN	That hast no less deserv'd, nor must be known
DUNCAN	No less to have done so, let me infold thee
DUNCAN	And hold thee to my heart.
DUNCAN	My plenteous joys
DUNCAN	Wanton in fulness, seek to hide themselves
DUNCAN	In drops of sorrow. Sons, kinsmen, thanes,
DUNCAN	And you whose places are the nearest, know
DUNCAN	We will establish our estate upon
DUNCAN	Our eldest, Malcolm, whom we name hereafter
DUNCAN	The Prince of Cumberland; which honour must
DUNCAN	Not unaccompanied invest him only,
DUNCAN	But signs of nobleness, like stars, shall shine
DUNCAN	On all deservers. From hence to Inverness,
DUNCAN	And bind us further to you.
DUNCAN	My worthy Cawdor!
DUNCAN	True, worthy Banquo; he is full so valiant,
DUNCAN	And in his commendations I am fed;
DUNCAN	It is a banquet to me. Let's after him,
DUNCAN	Whose care is gone before to bid us welcome:
DUNCAN	It is a peerless kinsman.
DUNCAN	They met me in the day of success; and I have learned by the perfectest report, they have more in them than mortal knowledge. When I burned in desire to question them further, they made themselves air, into which they vanished. Whiles I stood rapt in the wonder of it, came missives from the king, who all-hailed me, 'Thane of Cawdor;' by which title, before, these weird sisters saluted me, and referred me to the coming on of time, with, 'Hail, king that shall be!' This have I thought good to deliver thee, my dearest partner of greatness, that thou mightest not lose the dues of rejoicing, by being ignorant of what greatness is promised thee. Lay it to thy heart, and farewell.
DUNCAN	Glamis thou art, and Cawdor; and shalt be
DUNCAN	What thou art promis'd. Yet do I fear thy nature;
DUNCAN	It is too full o' the milk of human kindness
DUNCAN	To catch the nearest way; thou wouldst be great,
DUNCAN	Art not without ambition, but without
DUNCAN	The illness should attend it; what thou wouldst highly,
DUNCAN	That thou wouldst holily; wouldst not play false,
DUNCAN	And yet wouldst wrongly win; thou'dst have, great Glamis,
DUNCAN	That which cries, 'Thus thou must do, if thou have it;'
DUNCAN	And that which rather thou dost fear to do
DUNCAN	Than wishest should be undone. Hie thee hither,
DUNCAN	That I may pour my spirits in thine ear,
DUNCAN	And chastise with the valour of my tongue
DUNCAN	All that impedes thee from the golden round,
DUNCAN	Which fate and metaphysical aid doth seem
DUNCAN	To have thee crown'd withal.
DUNCAN	What is your tidings?
DUNCAN	This castle hath a pleasant seat; the air
DUNCAN	Nimbly and sweetly recommends itself
DUNCAN	Unto our gentle senses.
DUNCAN	See, see, our honour'd hostess!
DUNCAN	The love that follows us sometime is our trouble,
DUNCAN	Which still we thank as love. Herein I teach you
DUNCAN	How you shall bid God 'eyld us for your pains,
DUNCAN	And thank us for your trouble.
DUNCAN	Where's the Thane of Cawdor?
DUNCAN	We cours'd him at the heels, and had a purpose
DUNCAN	To be his purveyor; but he rides well,
DUNCAN	And his great love, sharp as his spur, hath holp him
DUNCAN	To his home before us. Fair and noble hostess,
DUNCAN	We are your guest to-night.
DUNCAN	Give me your hand;
DUNCAN	Conduct me to mine host: we love him highly,
DUNCAN	And shall continue our graces towards him.
DUNCAN	By your leave, hostess.
FRIAR LAURENCE	The grey-ey'd morn smiles on the frowning night,
FRIAR LAURENCE	Chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light,
FRIAR LAURENCE	And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels
FRIAR LAURENCE	From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels:
FRIAR LAURENCE	Now, ere the sun advance his burning eye
FRIAR LAURENCE	The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry,
FRIAR LAURENCE	I must up-fill this osier cage of ours
FRIAR LAURENCE	With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.
FRIAR LAURENCE	The earth that's nature's mother is her tomb;
FRIAR LAURENCE	What is her burying grave that is her womb,
FRIAR LAURENCE	And from her womb children of divers kind
FRIAR LAURENCE	We sucking on her natural bosom find,
FRIAR LAURENCE	Many for many virtues excellent,
FRIAR LAURENCE	None but for some, and yet all different.
FRIAR LAURENCE	O! mickle is the powerful grace that lies
FRIAR LAURENCE	In herbs, plants, stones, and their true qualities:
FRIAR LAURENCE	For nought so vile that on the earth doth live
FRIAR LAURENCE	But to the earth some special good doth give,
FRIAR LAURENCE	Nor aught so good but strain'd from that fair use
FRIAR LAURENCE	Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse:
FRIAR LAURENCE	Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied,
FRIAR LAURENCE	And vice sometime's by action dignified.
FRIAR LAURENCE	Within the infant rind of this weak flower
FRIAR LAURENCE	Poison hath residence and medicine power:
FRIAR LAURENCE	For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;
FRIAR LAURENCE	Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart.
FRIAR LAURENCE	Two such opposed foes encamp them still
FRIAR LAURENCE	In man as well as herbs, grace and rude will;
FRIAR LAURENCE	And where the worser is predominant,
FRIAR LAURENCE	Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.
FRIAR LAURENCE	Benedicite!
FRIAR LAURENCE	What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?
FRIAR LAURENCE	Young son, it argues a distemper'd head
FRIAR LAURENCE	So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed:
FRIAR LAURENCE	Care keeps his watch in every old man's eye,
FRIAR LAURENCE	And where care lodges, sleep will never lie;
FRIAR LAURENCE	But where unbruised youth with unstuff'd brain
FRIAR LAURENCE	Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign:
FRIAR LAURENCE	Therefore thy earliness doth me assure
FRIAR LAURENCE	Thou art up-rous'd by some distemperature;
FRIAR LAURENCE	Or if not so, then here I hit it right,
FRIAR LAURENCE	Our Romeo hath not been in bed to-night.
FRIAR LAURENCE	God pardon sin! wast thou with Rosaline?
FRIAR LAURENCE	That's my good son: but where hast thou been, then?
FRIAR LAURENCE	Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift;
FRIAR LAURENCE	Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.
FRIAR LAURENCE	Holy Saint Francis! what a change is here;
FRIAR LAURENCE	Is Rosaline, whom thou didst love so dear,
FRIAR LAURENCE	So soon forsaken? young men's love then lies
FRIAR LAURENCE	Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.
FRIAR LAURENCE	Jesu Maria! what a deal of brine
FRIAR LAURENCE	Hath wash'd thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline;
FRIAR LAURENCE	How much salt water thrown away in waste,
FRIAR LAURENCE	To season love, that of it doth not taste!
FRIAR LAURENCE	The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,
FRIAR LAURENCE	Thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears;
FRIAR LAURENCE	Lo! here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit
FRIAR LAURENCE	Of an old tear that is not wash'd off yet.
FRIAR LAURENCE	If e'er thou wast thyself and these woes thine,
FRIAR LAURENCE	Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline:
FRIAR LAURENCE	And art thou chang'd? pronounce this sentence then:
FRIAR LAURENCE	Women may fall, when there's no strength in men.
FRIAR LAURENCE	For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.
FRIAR LAURENCE	Not in a grave,
FRIAR LAURENCE	To lay one in, another out to have.
FRIAR LAURENCE	O! she knew well
FRIAR LAURENCE	Thy love did read by rote and could not spell.
FRIAR LAURENCE	But come, young waverer, come, go with me,
FRIAR LAURENCE	In one respect I'll thy assistant be;
FRIAR LAURENCE	For this alliance may so happy prove,
FRIAR LAURENCE	To turn your households' rancour to pure love.
FRIAR LAURENCE	Wisely and slow; they stumble that run fast.
FRIAR LAURENCE	So smile the heaven upon this holy act,
FRIAR LAURENCE	That after hours with sorrow chide us not!
FRIAR LAURENCE	These violent delights have violent ends,
FRIAR LAURENCE	And in their triumph die, like fire and powder,
FRIAR LAURENCE	Which, as they kiss consume: the sweetest honey
FRIAR LAURENCE	Is loathsome in his own deliciousness
FRIAR LAURENCE	And in the taste confounds the appetite:
FRIAR LAURENCE	Therefore love moderately; long love doth so;
FRIAR LAURENCE	Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.
FRIAR LAURENCE	Here comes the lady: O! so light a foot
FRIAR LAURENCE	Will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint:
FRIAR LAURENCE	A lover may bestride the gossamer
FRIAR LAURENCE	That idles in the wanton summer air,
FRIAR LAURENCE	And yet not fall; so light is vanity.
FRIAR LAURENCE	Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.
FRIAR LAURENCE	Come, come with me, and we will make short work;
FRIAR LAURENCE	For, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone
FRIAR LAURENCE	Till holy church incorporate two in one.
FRIAR LAURENCE	Romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man:
FRIAR LAURENCE	Affliction is enamour'd of thy parts,
FRIAR LAURENCE	And thou art wedded to calamity.
FRIAR LAURENCE	Too familiar
FRIAR LAURENCE	Is my dear son with such sour company:
FRIAR LAURENCE	I bring thee tidings of the prince's doom.
FRIAR LAURENCE	A gentler judgment vanish'd from his lips,
FRIAR LAURENCE	Not body's death, but body's banishment.
FRIAR LAURENCE	Hence from Verona art thou banished.
FRIAR LAURENCE	Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.
FRIAR LAURENCE	O deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness!
FRIAR LAURENCE	Thy fault our law calls death; but the kind prince,
FRIAR LAURENCE	Taking thy part, hath rush'd aside the law,
FRIAR LAURENCE	And turn'd that black word death to banishment:
FRIAR LAURENCE	This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not.
FRIAR LAURENCE	Thou fond mad man, hear me but speak a word.
FRIAR LAURENCE	I'll give thee armour to keep off that word;
FRIAR LAURENCE	Adversity's sweet milk, philosophy,
FRIAR LAURENCE	To comfort thee, though thou art banished.
FRIAR LAURENCE	O! then I see that madmen have no ears.
FRIAR LAURENCE	Let me dispute with thee of thy estate.
FRIAR LAURENCE	Arise; one knocks: good Romeo, hide thyself.
FRIAR LAURENCE	Hark! how they knock. Who's there? Romeo arise;
FRIAR LAURENCE	Thou wilt be taken. Stay awhile! Stand up;
FRIAR LAURENCE	Run to my study. By and by! God's will!
FRIAR LAURENCE	What wilfulness is this! I come, I come!
FRIAR LAURENCE	Who knocks so hard? whence come you? what's your will?
FRIAR LAURENCE	Welcome, then.
FRIAR LAURENCE	There on the ground, with his own tears made drunk.
FRIAR LAURENCE	O woeful sympathy!
FRIAR LAURENCE	Piteous predicament! Even so lies she,
FRIAR LAURENCE	Blubbering and weeping, weeping and blubbering.
FRIAR LAURENCE	Stand up, stand up; stand, an you be a man:
FRIAR LAURENCE	For Juliet's sake, for her sake, rise and stand;
FRIAR LAURENCE	Why should you fall into so deep an O?
FRIAR LAURENCE	Hold thy desperate hand:
FRIAR LAURENCE	Art thou a man? thy form cries out thou art:
FRIAR LAURENCE	Thy tears are womanish; thy wild acts denote
FRIAR LAURENCE	The unreasonable fury of a beast:
FRIAR LAURENCE	Unseemly woman in a seeming man;
FRIAR LAURENCE	Or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!
FRIAR LAURENCE	Thou hast amaz'd me: by my holy order,
FRIAR LAURENCE	I thought thy disposition better temper'd.
FRIAR LAURENCE	Hast thou slain Tybalt? wilt thou slay thyself?
FRIAR LAURENCE	And slay thy lady that in thy life lives,
FRIAR LAURENCE	By doing damned hate upon thyself?
FRIAR LAURENCE	Why rail'st thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth?
FRIAR LAURENCE	Since birth, and heaven, and earth, all three do meet
FRIAR LAURENCE	In thes at once, which thou at once wouldst lose.
FRIAR LAURENCE	Fie, fie! thou sham'st thy shape, thy love, thy wit,
FRIAR LAURENCE	Which, like a usurer, abound'st in all,
FRIAR LAURENCE	And usest none in that true use indeed
FRIAR LAURENCE	Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit.
FRIAR LAURENCE	Thy noble shape is but a form of wax,
FRIAR LAURENCE	Digressing from the valour of a man;
FRIAR LAURENCE	Thy dear love, sworn, but hollow perjury,
FRIAR LAURENCE	Killing that love which thou hast vow'd to cherish;
FRIAR LAURENCE	Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,
FRIAR LAURENCE	Misshapen in the conduct of them both,
FRIAR LAURENCE	Like powder in a skilless soldier's flask,
FRIAR LAURENCE	To set a-fire by thine own ignorance,
FRIAR LAURENCE	And thou dismember'd with thine own defence.
FRIAR LAURENCE	What! rouse thee, man; thy Juliet is alive,
FRIAR LAURENCE	For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead;
FRIAR LAURENCE	There art thou happy: Tybalt would kill thee,
FRIAR LAURENCE	But thou slew'st Tybalt; there art thou happy too:
FRIAR LAURENCE	The law that threaten'd death becomes thy friend,
FRIAR LAURENCE	And turns it to exile; there art thou happy:
FRIAR LAURENCE	A pack of blessings light upon thy back;
FRIAR LAURENCE	Happiness courts thee in her best array;
FRIAR LAURENCE	But, like a misbehav'd and sullen wench,
FRIAR LAURENCE	Thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love.
FRIAR LAURENCE	Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.
FRIAR LAURENCE	Go, get thee to thy love, as was decreed,
FRIAR LAURENCE	Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her;
FRIAR LAURENCE	But look thou stay not till the watch be set,
FRIAR LAURENCE	For then thou canst not pass to Mantua;
FRIAR LAURENCE	Where thou shalt live, till we can find a time
FRIAR LAURENCE	To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,
FRIAR LAURENCE	Beg pardon of the prince, and call thee back
FRIAR LAURENCE	With twenty hundred thousand times more joy
FRIAR LAURENCE	Than thou went'st forth in lamentation.
FRIAR LAURENCE	Go before, nurse: commend me to thy lady;
FRIAR LAURENCE	And bid her hasten all the house to bed,
FRIAR LAURENCE	Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto:
FRIAR LAURENCE	Romeo is coming.
FRIAR LAURENCE	Go hence; good-night; and here stands all your state:
FRIAR LAURENCE	Either be gone before the watch be set,
FRIAR LAURENCE	Or by the break of day disguis'd from hence:
FRIAR LAURENCE	Sojourn in Mantua; I'll find out your man,
FRIAR LAURENCE	And he shall signify from time to time
FRIAR LAURENCE	Every good hap to you that chances here.
FRIAR LAURENCE	Give me thy hand; 'tis late: farewell; goodnight.
FRIAR LAURENCE	On Thursday, sir? the time is very short.
FRIAR LAURENCE	You say you do not know the lady's mind:
FRIAR LAURENCE	Uneven is the course, I like it not.
FRIAR LAURENCE	I would I knew not why it should be slow'd.
FRIAR LAURENCE	Look, sir, here comes the lady towards my cell.
FRIAR LAURENCE	That's a certain text.
FRIAR LAURENCE	My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now:
FRIAR LAURENCE	My lord, we must entreat the time alone.
FRIAR LAURENCE	Ah! Juliet, I already know thy grief;
FRIAR LAURENCE	It strains me past the compass of my wits:
FRIAR LAURENCE	I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,
FRIAR LAURENCE	On Thursday next be married to this county.
FRIAR LAURENCE	Hold, daughter; I do spy a kind of hope,
FRIAR LAURENCE	Which craves as desperate an execution
FRIAR LAURENCE	As that is desperate which we would prevent.
FRIAR LAURENCE	If, rather than to marry County Paris,
FRIAR LAURENCE	Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,
FRIAR LAURENCE	Then is it likely thou wilt undertake
FRIAR LAURENCE	A thing like death to chide away this shame,
FRIAR LAURENCE	That cop'st with death himself to 'scape from it;
FRIAR LAURENCE	And, if thou dar'st, I'll give thee remedy.
FRIAR LAURENCE	Hold, then; go home, be merry, give consent
FRIAR LAURENCE	To marry Paris: Wednesday is to-morrow!
FRIAR LAURENCE	To-morrow night look that thou lie alone,
FRIAR LAURENCE	Let not thy nurse lie with thee in thy chamber:
FRIAR LAURENCE	Take thou this vial, being then in bed,
FRIAR LAURENCE	And this distilled liquor drink thou off;
FRIAR LAURENCE	When presently through all thy veins shall run
FRIAR LAURENCE	A cold and drowsy humour, for no pulse
FRIAR LAURENCE	Shall keep his native progress, but surcease;
FRIAR LAURENCE	No warmth, no breath, shall testify thou liv'st;
FRIAR LAURENCE	The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade
FRIAR LAURENCE	To paly ashes; thy eyes' windows fall,
FRIAR LAURENCE	Like death, when he shuts up the day of life;
FRIAR LAURENCE	Each part, depriv'd of supple government,
FRIAR LAURENCE	Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death;
FRIAR LAURENCE	And in this borrow'd likeness of shrunk death
FRIAR LAURENCE	Thou shalt continue two-and-forty hours,
FRIAR LAURENCE	And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.
FRIAR LAURENCE	Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes
FRIAR LAURENCE	To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead:
FRIAR LAURENCE	Then—as the manner of our country is—
FRIAR LAURENCE	In thy best robes uncover'd on the bier,
FRIAR LAURENCE	Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault
FRIAR LAURENCE	Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.
FRIAR LAURENCE	In the mean time, against thou shalt awake,
FRIAR LAURENCE	Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift,
FRIAR LAURENCE	And hither shall he come; and he and I
FRIAR LAURENCE	Will watch thy waking, and that very night
FRIAR LAURENCE	Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.
FRIAR LAURENCE	And this shall free thee from this present shame;
FRIAR LAURENCE	If no unconstant toy, nor womanish fear,
FRIAR LAURENCE	Abate thy valour in the acting it.
FRIAR LAURENCE	Hold; get you gone, be strong and prosperous
FRIAR LAURENCE	In this resolve. I'll send a friar with speed
FRIAR LAURENCE	To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord.
FRIAR LAURENCE	Come, is the bride ready to go to church?
FRIAR LAURENCE	Peace, ho! for shame! confusion's cure lives not
FRIAR LAURENCE	In these confusions. Heaven and yourself
FRIAR LAURENCE	Had part in this fair maid; now heaven hath all,
FRIAR LAURENCE	And all the better is it for the maid:
FRIAR LAURENCE	Your part in her you could not keep from death,
FRIAR LAURENCE	But heaven keeps his part in eternal life.
FRIAR LAURENCE	The most you sought was her promotion,
FRIAR LAURENCE	For 'twas your heaven she should be advanc'd;
FRIAR LAURENCE	And weep ye now, seeing she is advanc'd
FRIAR LAURENCE	Above the clouds, as high as heaven itself?
FRIAR LAURENCE	O! in this love, you love your child so ill,
FRIAR LAURENCE	That you run mad, seeing that she is well:
FRIAR LAURENCE	She's not well married that lives married long;
FRIAR LAURENCE	But she's best married that dies married young.
FRIAR LAURENCE	Dry up your tears, and stick your rosemary
FRIAR LAURENCE	On this fair corse; and, as the custom is,
FRIAR LAURENCE	In all her best array bear her to church;
FRIAR LAURENCE	For though fond nature bids us all lament,
FRIAR LAURENCE	Yet nature's tears are reason's merriment.
FRIAR LAURENCE	Sir, go you in; and, madam, go with him;
FRIAR LAURENCE	And go, Sir Paris; every one prepare
FRIAR LAURENCE	To follow this fair corse unto her grave.
FRIAR LAURENCE	The heavens do lower upon you for some ill;
FRIAR LAURENCE	Move them no more by crossing their high will.
FRIAR LAURENCE	This same should be the voice of Friar John.
FRIAR LAURENCE	Welcome from Mantua: what says Romeo?
FRIAR LAURENCE	Or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter.
FRIAR LAURENCE	Who bare my letter then to Romeo?
FRIAR LAURENCE	Unhappy fortune! by my brotherhood,
FRIAR LAURENCE	The letter was not nice, but full of charge
FRIAR LAURENCE	Of dear import; and the neglecting it
FRIAR LAURENCE	May do much danger. Friar John, go hence;
FRIAR LAURENCE	Get me an iron crow, and bring it straight
FRIAR LAURENCE	Unto my cell.
FRIAR LAURENCE	Now must I to the monument alone;
FRIAR LAURENCE	Within these three hours will fair Juliet wake:
FRIAR LAURENCE	She will beshrew me much that Romeo
FRIAR LAURENCE	Hath had no notice of these accidents;
FRIAR LAURENCE	But I will write again to Mantus,
FRIAR LAURENCE	And keep her at my cell till Romeo come:
FRIAR LAURENCE	Poor living corse, clos'd in a dead man's tomb!
FRIAR LAURENCE	Saint Francis be my speed! how oft to-night
FRIAR LAURENCE	Have my old feet stumbled at graves! Who's there?
FRIAR LAURENCE	Bliss be upon you! Tell me, good my friend,
FRIAR LAURENCE	What torch is yond, that vainly lends his light
FRIAR LAURENCE	To grubs and eyeless skulls? as I discern,
FRIAR LAURENCE	It burneth in the Capel's monument.
FRIAR LAURENCE	Who is it?
FRIAR LAURENCE	How long hath he been there?
FRIAR LAURENCE	Go with me to the vault.
FRIAR LAURENCE	Stay then, I'll go alone. Fear comes upon me;
FRIAR LAURENCE	O! much I fear some ill unlucky thing.
FRIAR LAURENCE	Romeo!
FRIAR LAURENCE	Alack, alack! what blood is this which stains
FRIAR LAURENCE	The stony entrance of this sepulchre?
FRIAR LAURENCE	What mean these masterless and gory swords
FRIAR LAURENCE	To lie discolour'd by this place of peace?
FRIAR LAURENCE	Romeo! O, pale! Who else? what! Paris too?
FRIAR LAURENCE	And steep'd in blood? Ah! what an unkind hour
FRIAR LAURENCE	Is guilty of this lamentable chance.
FRIAR LAURENCE	The lady stirs.
FRIAR LAURENCE	I hear some noise. Lady, come from that nest
FRIAR LAURENCE	Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep:
FRIAR LAURENCE	A greater power than we can contradict
FRIAR LAURENCE	Hath thwarted our intents: come, come away.
FRIAR LAURENCE	Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead;
FRIAR LAURENCE	And Paris too: come, I'll dispose of thee
FRIAR LAURENCE	Among a sisterhood of holy nuns.
FRIAR LAURENCE	Stay not to question, for the watch is coming;
FRIAR LAURENCE	Come, go, good Juliet.—
FRIAR LAURENCE	I dare no longer stay.
FRIAR LAURENCE	I am the greatest, able to do least,
FRIAR LAURENCE	Yet most suspected, as the time and place
FRIAR LAURENCE	Doth make against me, of this direful murder;
FRIAR LAURENCE	And here I stand, both to impeach and purge
FRIAR LAURENCE	Myself condemned and myself excus'd.
FRIAR LAURENCE	I will be brief, for my short date of breath
FRIAR LAURENCE	Is not so long as is a tedious tale.
FRIAR LAURENCE	Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet;
FRIAR LAURENCE	And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife:
FRIAR LAURENCE	I married them; and their stolen marriage-day
FRIAR LAURENCE	Was Tybalt's doomsday, whose untimely death
FRIAR LAURENCE	Banish'd the new-made bridegroom from this city;
FRIAR LAURENCE	For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pin'd.
FRIAR LAURENCE	You, to remove that siege of grief from her,
FRIAR LAURENCE	Betroth'd, and would have married her perforce,
FRIAR LAURENCE	To County Paris: then comes she to me,
FRIAR LAURENCE	And, with wild looks bid me devise some mean
FRIAR LAURENCE	To rid her from this second marriage,
FRIAR LAURENCE	Or in my cell there would she kill herself.
FRIAR LAURENCE	Then gave I her,—so tutor'd by my art,—
FRIAR LAURENCE	A sleeping potion; which so took effect
FRIAR LAURENCE	As I intended, for it wrought on her
FRIAR LAURENCE	The form of death: meantime I writ to Romeo
FRIAR LAURENCE	That he should hither come as this dire night,
FRIAR LAURENCE	To help to take her from her borrow'd grave,
FRIAR LAURENCE	Being the time the potion's force should cease.
FRIAR LAURENCE	But he which bore my letter, Friar John,
FRIAR LAURENCE	Was stay'd by accident, and yesternight
FRIAR LAURENCE	Return'd my letter back. Then, all alone,
FRIAR LAURENCE	At the prefixed hour of her waking,
FRIAR LAURENCE	Came I to take her from her kindred's vault,
FRIAR LAURENCE	Meaning to keep her closely at my cell,
FRIAR LAURENCE	Till I conveniently could send to Romeo:
FRIAR LAURENCE	But, when I came,—some minute ere the time
FRIAR LAURENCE	Of her awakening,—here untimely lay
FRIAR LAURENCE	The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.
FRIAR LAURENCE	She wakes; and I entreated her come forth,
FRIAR LAURENCE	And bear this work of heaven with patience;
FRIAR LAURENCE	But then a noise did scare me from the tomb,
FRIAR LAURENCE	And she, too desperate, would not go with me,
FRIAR LAURENCE	But, as it seems, did violence on herself.
FRIAR LAURENCE	All this I know; and to the marriage
FRIAR LAURENCE	Her nurse is privy: and, if aught in this
FRIAR LAURENCE	Miscarried by my fault, let my old life
FRIAR LAURENCE	Be sacrific'd, some hour before his time,
FRIAR LAURENCE	Unto the rigour of severest law.
HAMLET	A little more than kin, and less than kind.
HAMLET	Not so, my lord; I am too much i' the sun.
HAMLET	Ay, madam, it is common.
HAMLET	Seems, madam! Nay, it is; I know not 'seems.'
HAMLET	'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,
HAMLET	Nor customary suits of solemn black,
HAMLET	Nor windy suspiration of forc'd breath,
HAMLET	No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
HAMLET	Nor the dejected haviour of the visage,
HAMLET	Together with all forms, modes, shows of grief,
HAMLET	That can denote me truly; these indeed seem,
HAMLET	For they are actions that a man might play:
HAMLET	But I have that within which passeth show;
HAMLET	These but the trappings and the suits of woe.
HAMLET	I shall in all my best obey you, madam.
HAMLET	O! that this too too solid flesh would melt,
HAMLET	Thaw and resolve itself into a dew;
HAMLET	Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd
HAMLET	His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! O God!
HAMLET	How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable
HAMLET	Seem to me all the uses of this world.
HAMLET	Fie on 't! O fie! 'tis an unweeded garden,
HAMLET	That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature
HAMLET	Possess it merely. That it should come to this!
HAMLET	But two months dead: nay, not so much, not two:
HAMLET	So excellent a king; that was, to this,
HAMLET	Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother
HAMLET	That he might not beteem the winds of heaven
HAMLET	Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!
HAMLET	Must I remember? why, she would hang on him,
HAMLET	As if increase of appetite had grown
HAMLET	By what it fed on; and yet, within a month,
HAMLET	Let me not think on't: Frailty, thy name is woman!
HAMLET	A little month; or ere those shoes were old
HAMLET	With which she follow'd my poor father's body,
HAMLET	Like Niobe, all tears; why she, even she,—
HAMLET	O God! a beast, that wants discourse of reason,
HAMLET	Would have mourn'd longer,—married with mine uncle,
HAMLET	My father's brother, but no more like my father
HAMLET	Than I to Hercules: within a month,
HAMLET	Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears
HAMLET	Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,
HAMLET	She married. O! most wicked speed, to post
HAMLET	With such dexterity to incestuous sheets.
HAMLET	It is not nor it cannot come to good;
HAMLET	But break, my heart, for I must hold my tongue!
HAMLET	I am glad to see you well:
HAMLET	Horatio, or I do forget myself.
HAMLET	Sir, my good friend; I'll change that name with you.
HAMLET	And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio?
HAMLET	Marcellus?
HAMLET	I am very glad to see you.
HAMLET	Good even, sir.
HAMLET	But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?
HAMLET	I would not hear your enemy say so,
HAMLET	Nor shall you do mine ear that violence,
HAMLET	To make it truster of your own report
HAMLET	Against yourself; I know you are no truant.
HAMLET	But what is your affair in Elsinore?
HAMLET	We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.
HAMLET	I pray thee, do not mock me, fellow-student;
HAMLET	I think it was to see my mother's wedding.
HAMLET	Thrift, thrift, Horatio! the funeral bak'd meats
HAMLET	Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.
HAMLET	Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven
HAMLET	Ere I had ever seen that day, Horatio!
HAMLET	My father, methinks I see my father.
HAMLET	In my mind's eye, Horatio.
HAMLET	He was a man, take him for all in all,
HAMLET	I shall not look upon his like again.
HAMLET	Saw who?
HAMLET	The king, my father!
HAMLET	For God's love, let me hear.
HAMLET	But where was this?
HAMLET	Did you not speak to it?
HAMLET	'Tis very strange.
HAMLET	Indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me.
HAMLET	Hold you the watch to-night?
HAMLET	Arm'd, say you?
HAMLET	From top to toe?
HAMLET	Then saw you not his face?
HAMLET	What! look'd he frowningly?
HAMLET	Pale or red?
HAMLET	And fix'd his eyes upon you?
HAMLET	I would I had been there.
HAMLET	Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?
HAMLET	His beard was grizzled, no?
HAMLET	I will watch to-night;
HAMLET	Perchance 'twill walk again.
HAMLET	If it assume my noble father's person,
HAMLET	I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape
HAMLET	And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,
HAMLET	If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,
HAMLET	Let it be tenable in your silence still;
HAMLET	And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,
HAMLET	Give it an understanding, but no tongue:
HAMLET	I will requite your loves. So, fare you well.
HAMLET	Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,
HAMLET	I'll visit you.
HAMLET	Your loves, as mine to you. Farewell.
HAMLET	My father's spirit in arms! all is not well;
HAMLET	I doubt some foul play: would the night were come!
HAMLET	Till then sit still, my soul: foul deeds will rise,
HAMLET	Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes.
HAMLET	The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.
HAMLET	What hour now?
HAMLET	The king doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,
HAMLET	Keeps wassail, and the swaggering up-spring reels;
HAMLET	And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,
HAMLET	The kettle-drum and trumpet thus bray out
HAMLET	The triumph of his pledge.
HAMLET	Ay, marry, is 't:
HAMLET	But to my mind,—though I am native here
HAMLET	And to the manner born,—it is a custom
HAMLET	More honour'd in the breach than the observance.
HAMLET	This heavy-headed revel east and west
HAMLET	Makes us traduc'd and tax'd of other nations;
HAMLET	They clepe us drunkards, and with swinish phrase
HAMLET	Soil our addition; and indeed it takes
HAMLET	From our achievements, though perform'd at height,
HAMLET	The pith and marrow of our attribute.
HAMLET	So, oft it chances in particular men,
HAMLET	That for some vicious mole of nature in them,
HAMLET	As, in their birth,—wherein they are not guilty,
HAMLET	Since nature cannot choose his origin,—
HAMLET	By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,
HAMLET	Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,
HAMLET	Or by some habit that too much o'er-leavens
HAMLET	The form of plausive manners; that these men,
HAMLET	Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,
HAMLET	Being nature's livery, or fortune's star,
HAMLET	Their virtues else, be they as pure as grace,
HAMLET	As infinite as man may undergo,
HAMLET	Shall in the general censure take corruption
HAMLET	From that particular fault: the dram of eale
HAMLET	Doth all the noble substance of a doubt,
HAMLET	To his own scandal.
HAMLET	Angels and ministers of grace defend us!
HAMLET	Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,
HAMLET	Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,
HAMLET	Be thy intents wicked or charitable,
HAMLET	Thou com'st in such a questionable shape
HAMLET	That I will speak to thee: I'll call thee Hamlet,
HAMLET	King, father; royal Dane, O! answer me:
HAMLET	Let me not burst in ignorance; but tell
HAMLET	Why thy canoniz'd bones, hearsed in death,
HAMLET	Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre,
HAMLET	Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd,
HAMLET	Hath op'd his ponderous and marble jaws,
HAMLET	To cast thee up again. What may this mean,
HAMLET	That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel
HAMLET	Revisit'st thus the glimpses of the moon,
HAMLET	Making night hideous; and we fools of nature
HAMLET	So horridly to shake our disposition
HAMLET	With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?
HAMLET	Say, why is this? wherefore? what should we do?
HAMLET	It will not speak; then, will I follow it.
HAMLET	Why, what should be the fear?
HAMLET	I do not set my life at a pin's fee;
HAMLET	And for my soul, what can it do to that,
HAMLET	Being a thing immortal as itself?
HAMLET	It waves me forth again; I'll follow it.
HAMLET	It waves me still. Go on, I'll follow thee.
HAMLET	Hold off your hands!
HAMLET	My fate cries out,
HAMLET	And makes each petty artery in this body
HAMLET	As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.
HAMLET	Still am I call'd. Unhand me, gentlemen,
HAMLET	By heaven! I'll make a ghost of him that lets me:
HAMLET	I say, away! Go on, I'll follow thee.
HAMLET	Whither wilt thou lead me? speak; I'll go no further.
HAMLET	I will.
HAMLET	Alas! poor ghost.
HAMLET	Speak; I am bound to hear.
HAMLET	What?
HAMLET	O God!
HAMLET	Murder!
HAMLET	Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift
HAMLET	As meditation or the thoughts of love,
HAMLET	May sweep to my revenge.
HAMLET	O my prophetic soul!
HAMLET	My uncle!
HAMLET	O all you host of heaven! O earth! What else?
HAMLET	And shall I couple hell? O fie! Hold, hold, my heart!
HAMLET	And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,
HAMLET	But bear me stiffly up! Remember thee!
HAMLET	Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat
HAMLET	In this distracted globe. Remember thee!
HAMLET	Yea, from the table of my memory
HAMLET	I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,
HAMLET	All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past,
HAMLET	That youth and observation copied there;
HAMLET	And thy commandment all alone shall live
HAMLET	Within the book and volume of my brain,
HAMLET	Unmix'd with baser matter: yes, by heaven!
HAMLET	O most pernicious woman!
HAMLET	O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!
HAMLET	My tables,—meet it is I set it down,
HAMLET	That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain;
HAMLET	At least I'm sure it may be so in Denmark:
HAMLET	So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word;
HAMLET	It is, 'Adieu, adieu! remember me.
HAMLET	I have sworn 't.
HAMLET	Hillo, ho, ho, boy! come, bird, come.
HAMLET	O! wonderful.
HAMLET	No; you will reveal it.
HAMLET	How say you, then; would heart of man once think it?
HAMLET	But you'll be secret?
HAMLET	There's ne'er a villain dwelling in all Denmark,
HAMLET	But he's an arrant knave.
HAMLET	Why, right; you are i' the right;
HAMLET	And so, without more circumstance at all,
HAMLET	I hold it fit that we shake hands and part;
HAMLET	You, as your business and desire shall point you,—
HAMLET	For every man hath business and desire,
HAMLET	Such as it is,—and, for mine own poor part,
HAMLET	Look you, I'll go pray.
HAMLET	I am sorry they offend you, heartily;
HAMLET	Yes, faith, heartily.
HAMLET	Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,
HAMLET	And much offence, too. Touching this vision here,
HAMLET	It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you;
HAMLET	For your desire to know what is between us,
HAMLET	O'ermaster't as you may. And now, good friends,
HAMLET	As you are friends, scholars, and soldiers,
HAMLET	Give me one poor request.
HAMLET	Never make known what you have seen to-night.
HAMLET	Nay, but swear't.
HAMLET	Upon my sword.
HAMLET	Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.
HAMLET	Ah, ha, boy! sayst thou so? art thou there, true-penny?
HAMLET	Come on,—you hear this fellow in the cellar-age,—
HAMLET	Consent to swear.
HAMLET	Never to speak of this that you have seen,
HAMLET	Swear by my sword.
HAMLET	Hic et ubique? then we'll shift our ground.
HAMLET	Come hither, gentlemen,
HAMLET	And lay your hands again upon my sword:
HAMLET	Never to speak of this that you have heard,
HAMLET	Swear by my sword.
HAMLET	Well said, old mole! canst work i' the earth so fast?
HAMLET	A worthy pioner! once more remove, good friends.
HAMLET	And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.
HAMLET	There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,
HAMLET	Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.
HAMLET	But come;
HAMLET	Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,
HAMLET	How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself,
HAMLET	As I perchance hereafter shall think meet
HAMLET	To put an antic disposition on,
HAMLET	That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,
HAMLET	With arms encumber'd thus, or this head-shake,
HAMLET	Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,
HAMLET	As, 'Well, well, we know,' or, 'We could, an if we would;'
HAMLET	Or, 'If we list to speak,' or, 'There be, an if they might;'
HAMLET	Or such ambiguous giving out, to note
HAMLET	That you know aught of me: this not to do,
HAMLET	So grace and mercy at your most need help you,
HAMLET	Swear.
HAMLET	Rest, rest, perturbed spirit! So, gentlemen,
HAMLET	With all my love I do commend me to you:
HAMLET	And what so poor a man as Hamlet is
HAMLET	May do, to express his love and friending to you,
HAMLET	God willing, shall not lack. Let us go in together;
HAMLET	And still your fingers on your lips, I pray.
HAMLET	The time is out of joint; O cursed spite,
HAMLET	That ever I was born to set it right!
HAMLET	Nay, come, let's go together.
HAMLET	Well, God a-mercy.
HAMLET	Excellent well; you are a fishmonger.
HAMLET	Then I would you were so honest a man.
HAMLET	Ay, sir; to be honest, as this world goes, is to be one man picked out of ten thousand.
HAMLET	For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a good kissing carrion,—Have you a daughter?
HAMLET	Let her not walk i' the sun: conception is a blessing; but not as your daughter may conceive. Friend, look to 't.
HAMLET	Words, words, words.
HAMLET	Between who?
HAMLET	Slanders, sir: for the satirical rogue says here that old men have grey beards, that their faces are wrinkled, their eyes purging thick amber and plum-tree gum, and that they have a plentiful lack of wit, together with most weak hams: all which, sir, though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet I hold it not honesty to have it thus set down; for you yourself, sir, should be old as I am, if, like a crab, you could go backward.
HAMLET	Into my grave?
HAMLET	You cannot, sir, take from me any thing that I will more willingly part withal; except my life, except my life, except my life.
HAMLET	These tedious old fools!
HAMLET	My excellent good friends! How dost thou, Guildenstern? Ah, Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do ye both?
HAMLET	Nor the soles of her shoe?
HAMLET	Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of her favours?
HAMLET	In the secret parts of Fortune? O! most true; she is a strumpet. What news?
HAMLET	Then is doomsday near; but your news is not true. Let me question more in particular: what have you, my good friends, deserved at the hands of Fortune, that she sends you to prison hither?
HAMLET	Denmark's a prison.
HAMLET	A goodly one; in which there are many confines, wards, and dungeons, Denmark being one o' the worst.
HAMLET	Why, then, 'tis none to you; for there is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so: to me it is a prison.
HAMLET	O God! I could be bounded in a nutshell, and count myself a king of infinite space, were it not that I have bad dreams.
HAMLET	A dream itself is but a shadow.
HAMLET	Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and outstretched heroes the beggars' shadows. Shall we to the court? for, by my fay, I cannot reason.
HAMLET	No such matter; I will not sort you with the rest of my servants, for, to speak to you like an honest man, I am most dreadfully attended. But, in the beaten way of friendship, what make you at Elsinore?
HAMLET	Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I thank you: and sure, dear friends, my thanks are too dear a halfpenny. Were you not sent for? Is it your own inclining? Is it a free visitation? Come, come, deal justly with me: come, come; nay, speak.
HAMLET	Why anything, but to the purpose. You were sent for; and there is a kind of confession in your looks which your modesties have not craft enough to colour: I know the good king and queen have sent for you.
HAMLET	That you must teach me. But let me conjure you, by the rights of our fellowship, by the consonancy of our youth, by the obligation of our ever-preserved love, and by what more dear a better proposer could charge you withal, be even and direct with me, whether you were sent for or no!
HAMLET	Nay, then, I have an eye of you. If you love me, hold not off.
HAMLET	I will tell you why; so shall my anticipation prevent your discovery, and your secrecy to the king and queen moult no feather. I have of late,—but wherefore I know not,—lost all my mirth, forgone all custom of exercises; and indeed it goes so heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame, the earth, seems to me a sterile promontory; this most excellent canopy, the air, look you, this brave o'erhanging firmament, this majestical roof fretted with golden fire, why, it appears no other thing to me but a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours. What a piece of work is a man! How noble in reason! how infinite in faculty! in form, in moving, how express and admirable! in action how like an angel! in apprehension how like a god! the beauty of the world! the paragon of animals! And yet, to me, what is this quintessence of dust? man delights not me; no, nor woman neither, though, by your smiling, you seem to say so.
HAMLET	Why did you laugh then, when I said, 'man delights not me?'
HAMLET	He that plays the king shall be welcome; his majesty shall have tribute of me; the adventurous knight shall use his foil and target; the lover shall not sigh gratis; the humorous man shall end his part in peace; the clown shall make those laugh whose lungs are tickle o' the sere; and the lady shall say her mind freely, or the blank verse shall halt for't. What players are they?
HAMLET	How chances it they travel? their residence, both in reputation and profit, was better both ways.
HAMLET	Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was in the city? Are they so followed?
HAMLET	How comes it? Do they grow rusty?
HAMLET	What! are they children? who maintains 'em? how are they escoted? Will they pursue the quality no longer than they can sing? will they not say afterwards, if they should grow themselves to common players,—as it is most like, if their means are no better,—their writers do them wrong, to make them exclaim against their own succession?
HAMLET	Is it possible?
HAMLET	Do the boys carry it away?
HAMLET	It is not very strange; for my uncle is King of Denmark, and those that would make mows at him while my father lived, give twenty, forty, fifty, a hundred ducats a-piece for his picture in little. 'Sblood, there is something in this more than natural, if philosophy could find it out.
HAMLET	Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands, come then; the appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony: let me comply with you in this garb, lest my extent to the players—which, I tell you, must show fairly outward—should more appear like entertainment than yours. You are welcome; but my uncle-father and aunt-mother are deceived.
HAMLET	I am but mad north-north-west: when the wind is southerly I know a hawk from a handsaw.
HAMLET	Hark you, Guildenstern; and you too; at each ear a hearer: that great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling-clouts.
HAMLET	I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players; mark it. You say right, sir; o' Monday morning; 'twas so indeed.
HAMLET	My lord, I have news to tell you. When Roscius was an actor in Rome,—
HAMLET	Buzz, buzz!
HAMLET	Then came each actor on his ass,—
HAMLET	O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!
HAMLET	Why
HAMLET	One fair daughter and no more,
HAMLET	The which he loved passing well.
HAMLET	Am I not i' the right, old Jephthah?
HAMLET	Nay, that follows not.
HAMLET	Why,
HAMLET	As by lot, God wot.
HAMLET	And then, you know,
HAMLET	It came to pass, as most like it was.—
HAMLET	The first row of the pious chanson will show you more; for look where my abridgment comes.
HAMLET	You are welcome, masters; welcome, all. I am glad to see thee well: welcome, good friends. O, my old friend! Thy face is valanced since I saw thee last: comest thou to beard me in Denmark? What! my young lady and mistress! By 'r lady, your ladyship is nearer heaven than when I saw you last, by the altitude of a chopine. Pray God, your voice, like a piece of uncurrent gold, be not cracked within the ring. Masters, you are all welcome. We'll e'en to't like French falconers, fly at anything we see: we'll have a speech straight. Come, give us a taste of your quality; come, a passionate speech.
HAMLET	I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was never acted; or, if it was, not above once; for the play, I remember, pleased not the million; 'twas caviare to the general: but it was—as I received it, and others, whose judgments in such matters cried in the top of mine—an excellent play, well digested in the scenes, set down with as much modesty as cunning. I remember one said there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter savoury, nor no matter in the phrase that might indict the author of affectation; but called it an honest method, as wholesome as sweet, and by very much more handsome than fine. One speech in it I chiefly loved; 'twas Æneas' tale to Dido; and thereabout of it especially, where he speaks of Priam's slaughter. If it live in your memory, begin at this line: let me see, let me see:—
HAMLET	Therugged Pyrrhus, like the Hyrcanian beast,—
HAMLET	'tis not so, it begins with Pyrrhus:—
HAMLET	The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arm,
HAMLET	Black as his purpose, did the night resemble
HAMLET	When he lay couched in the ominous horse,
HAMLET	Hath now this dread and black complexion smear'd
HAMLET	With heraldry more dismal; head to foot
HAMLET	Now is he total gules; horridly trick'd
HAMLET	With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,
HAMLET	Bak'd and impasted with the parching streets,
HAMLET	That lend a tyrannous and damned light
HAMLET	To their vile murders: rousted in wrath and fire,
HAMLET	And thus o'er-sized with coagulate gore,
HAMLET	With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus
HAMLET	Old grandsire Priam seeks.
HAMLET	So proceed you.
HAMLET	It shall to the barber's, with your beard. Prithee, say on: he's for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he sleeps. Say on; come to Hecuba.
HAMLET	'The mobled queen?'—
HAMLET	'Tis well; I'll have thee speak out the rest soon. Good my lord, will you see the players well bestowed? Do you hear, let them be well used; for they are the abstracts and brief chronicles of the time: after your death you were better have a bad epitaph than their ill report while you live.
HAMLET	God's bodikins, man, much better; use every man after his desert, and who should 'scape whipping? Use them after your own honour and dignity: the less they deserve, the more merit is in your bounty. Take them in.
HAMLET	Follow him, friends: we'll hear a play to-morrow.
HAMLET	Dost thou hear me, old friend; can you play the Murder of Gonzago?
HAMLET	We'll ha't to-morrow night. You could, for a need, study a speech of some dozen or sixteen lines, which I would set down and insert in't, could you not?
HAMLET	Very well. Follow that lord; and look you mock him not.
HAMLET	My good friends, I'll leave you till night; you are welcome to Elsinore.
HAMLET	Ay, so, God be wi' ye! Now I am alone.
HAMLET	O! what a rogue and peasant slave am I:
HAMLET	Is it not monstrous that this player here,
HAMLET	But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,
HAMLET	Could force his soul so to his own conceit
HAMLET	That from her working all his visage wann'd,
HAMLET	Tears in his eyes, distraction in 's aspect,
HAMLET	A broken voice, and his whole function suiting
HAMLET	With forms to his conceit? and all for nothing!
HAMLET	For Hecuba!
HAMLET	What 's Hecuba to him or he to Hecuba
HAMLET	That he should weep for her? What would he do
HAMLET	Had he the motive and the cue for passion
HAMLET	That I have? He would drown the stage with tears,
HAMLET	And cleave the general ear with horrid speech,
HAMLET	Make mad the guilty and appal the free,
HAMLET	Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed
HAMLET	The very faculties of eyes and ears.
HAMLET	Yet I,
HAMLET	A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak,
HAMLET	Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,
HAMLET	And can say nothing; no, not for a king,
HAMLET	Upon whose property and most dear life
HAMLET	A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward?
HAMLET	Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across?
HAMLET	Plucks off my beard and blows it in my face?
HAMLET	Tweaks me by the nose? gives me the lie i' the throat,
HAMLET	As deep as to the lungs? Who does me this?
HAMLET	Ha!
HAMLET	Swounds, I should take it, for it cannot be
HAMLET	But I am pigeon-liver'd, and lack gall
HAMLET	To make oppression bitter, or ere this
HAMLET	I should have fatted all the region kites
HAMLET	With this slave's offal. Bloody, bawdy villain!
HAMLET	Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!
HAMLET	O! vengeance!
HAMLET	Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave
HAMLET	That I, the son of a dear father murder'd,
HAMLET	Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,
HAMLET	Must, like a whore, unpack my heart with words,
HAMLET	And fall a-cursing, like a very drab,
HAMLET	A scullion!
HAMLET	Fie upon't! foh! About, my brain! I have heard,
HAMLET	That guilty creatures sitting at a play
HAMLET	Have by the very cunning of the scene
HAMLET	Been struck so to the soul that presently
HAMLET	They have proclaim'd their malefactions;
HAMLET	For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak
HAMLET	With most miraculous organ. I'll have these players
HAMLET	Play something like the murder of my father
HAMLET	Before mine uncle; I'll observe his looks;
HAMLET	I'll tent him to the quick: if he but blench
HAMLET	I know my course. The spirit that I have seen
HAMLET	May be the devil: and the devil hath power
HAMLET	To assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps
HAMLET	Out of my weakness and my melancholy—
HAMLET	As he is very potent with such spirits—
HAMLET	Abuses me to damn me. I'll have grounds
HAMLET	More relative than this: the play 's the thing
HAMLET	Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king.
HAMLET	To be, or not to be: that is the question:
HAMLET	Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
HAMLET	The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
HAMLET	Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
HAMLET	And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep;
HAMLET	No more; and, by a sleep to say we end
HAMLET	The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks
HAMLET	That flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation
HAMLET	Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;
HAMLET	To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub;
HAMLET	For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
HAMLET	When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
HAMLET	Must give us pause. There's the respect
HAMLET	That makes calamity of so long life;
HAMLET	For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
HAMLET	The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
HAMLET	The pangs of dispriz'd love, the law's delay,
HAMLET	The insolence of office, and the spurns
HAMLET	That patient merit of the unworthy takes,
HAMLET	When he himself might his quietus make
HAMLET	With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear,
HAMLET	To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
HAMLET	But that the dread of something after death,
HAMLET	The undiscover'd country from whose bourn
HAMLET	No traveller returns, puzzles the will,
HAMLET	And makes us rather bear those ills we have
HAMLET	Than fly to others that we know not of?
HAMLET	Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;
HAMLET	And thus the native hue of resolution
HAMLET	Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
HAMLET	And enterprises of great pith and moment
HAMLET	With this regard their currents turn awry,
HAMLET	And lose the name of action. Soft you now!
HAMLET	The fair Ophelia! Nymph, in thy orisons
HAMLET	Be all my sins remember'd.
HAMLET	I humbly thank you; well, well, well.
HAMLET	No, not I;
HAMLET	I never gave you aught.
HAMLET	Ha, ha! are you honest?
HAMLET	Are you fair?
HAMLET	That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should admit no discourse to your beauty.
HAMLET	Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can translate beauty into his likeness: this was sometime a paradox, but now the time gives it proof. I did love thee once.
HAMLET	You should not have believed me; for virtue cannot so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it: I loved you not.
HAMLET	Get thee to a nunnery: why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners? I am myself indifferent honest; but yet I could accuse me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne me. I am very proud, revengeful, ambitious; with more offences at my beck than I have thoughts to put them in, imagination to give them shape, or time to act them in. What should such fellows as I do crawling between heaven and earth? We are arrant knaves, all; believe none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery. Where's your father?
HAMLET	Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the fool nowhere but in's own house. Farewell.
HAMLET	If thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague for thy dowry: be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not escape calumny. Get thee to a nunnery, go; farewell. Or, if thou wilt needs marry, marry a fool; for wise men know well enough what monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go; and quickly too. Farewell.
HAMLET	I have heard of your paintings too, well enough; God hath given you one face, and you make yourselves another: you jig, you amble, and you lisp, and nickname God's creatures, and make your wantonness your ignorance. Go to, I'll no more on't; it hath made me mad. I say, we will have no more marriages; those that are married already, all but one, shall live; the rest shall keep as they are. To a nunnery, go.
HAMLET	Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to you, trippingly on the tongue; but if you mouth it, as many of your players do, I had as lief the town-crier spoke my lines. Nor do not saw the air too much with your hand, thus; but use all gently: for in the very torrent, tempest, and—as I may say—whirlwind of passion, you must acquire and beget a temperance, that may give it smoothness. O! it offends me to the soul to hear a robustious periwigpated fellow tear a passion to tatters, to very rage, to split the ears of the groundlings, who for the most part are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb-shows and noise: I would have such a fellow whipped for o'er-doing Termagant; it out-herods Herod: pray you, avoid it.
HAMLET	Be not too tame neither, but let your own discretion be your tutor: suit the action to the word, the word to the action; with this special observance, that you o'erstep not the modesty of nature; for anything so overdone is from the purpose of playing, whose end, both at the first and now, was and is, to hold, as 'twere, the mirror up to nature; to show virtue her own feature, scorn her own image, and the very age and body of the time his form and pressure. Now, this overdone, or come tardy off, though it make the unskilful laugh, cannot but make the judicious grieve; the censure of which one must in your allowance o'erweigh a whole theatre of others. O! there be players that I have seen play, and heard others praise, and that highly, not to speak it profanely, that, neither having the accent of Christians nor the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have so strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of nature's journeymen had made men and not made them well, they imitated humanity so abominably.
HAMLET	O! reform it altogether. And let those that play your clowns speak no more than is set down for them; for there be of them that will themselves laugh, to set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh too, though in the mean time some necessary question of the play be then to be considered; that's villanous, and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it. Go, make you ready.
HAMLET	How now, my lord! will the king hear this piece of work?
HAMLET	Bid the players make haste.
HAMLET	Will you two help to hasten them?
HAMLET	What, ho! Horatio!
HAMLET	Horatio, thou art e'en as just a man
HAMLET	As e'er my conversation cop'd withal.
HAMLET	Nay, do not think I flatter;
HAMLET	For what advancement may I hope from thee,
HAMLET	That no revenue hast but thy good spirits
HAMLET	To feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be flatter'd?
HAMLET	No; let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp,
HAMLET	And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee
HAMLET	Where thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear?
HAMLET	Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice
HAMLET	And could of men distinguish, her election
HAMLET	Hath seal'd thee for herself; for thou hast been
HAMLET	As one, in suffering all, that suffers nothing,
HAMLET	A man that fortune's buffets and rewards
HAMLET	Hast ta'en with equal thanks; and bless'd are those
HAMLET	Whose blood and judgment are so well comingled
HAMLET	That they are not a pipe for fortune's finger
HAMLET	To sound what stop she please. Give me that man
HAMLET	That is not passion's slave, and I will wear him
HAMLET	In my heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart,
HAMLET	As I do thee. Something too much of this.
HAMLET	There is a play to-night before the king;
HAMLET	One scene of it comes near the circumstance
HAMLET	Which I have told thee of my father's death:
HAMLET	I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot,
HAMLET	Even with the very comment of thy soul
HAMLET	Observe mine uncle; if his occulted guilt
HAMLET	Do not itself unkennel in one speech,
HAMLET	It is a damned ghost that we have seen,
HAMLET	And my imaginations are as foul
HAMLET	As Vulcan's stithy. Give him heedful note;
HAMLET	For I mine eyes will rivet to his face,
HAMLET	And after we will both our judgments join
HAMLET	In censure of his seeming.
HAMLET	They are coming to the play; I must be idle:
HAMLET	Get you a place.
HAMLET	Excellent, i' faith; of the chameleon's dish: I eat the air, promise-crammed; you cannot feed capons so.
HAMLET	No, nor mine now.
HAMLET	My lord, you played once i' the university, you say?
HAMLET	And what did you enact?
HAMLET	It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf there. Be the playcrs ready?
HAMLET	No, good mother, here's metal more attractive.
HAMLET	Lady, shall I lie in your lap?
HAMLET	I mean, my head upon your lap?
HAMLET	Do you think I meant country matters?
HAMLET	That's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs.
HAMLET	Nothing.
HAMLET	Who, I?
HAMLET	O God, your only jig-maker. What should a man do but be merry? for, look you, how cheerfully my mother looks, and my father died within's two hours.
HAMLET	So long? Nay, then, let the devil wear black, for I'll have a suit of sables. O heavens! die two months ago, and not forgotten yet? Then there's hope a great man's memory may outlive his life half a year; but, by'r lady, he must build churches then, or else shall he suffer not thinking on, with the hobby-horse, whose epitaph is, 'For, O! for, O! the hobby-horse is forgot.'
HAMLET	Marry, this is miching mallecho; it means mischief.
HAMLET	We shall know by this fellow: the players cannot keep counsel; they'll tell all.
HAMLET	Ay, or any show that you'll show him; be not you ashamed to show, he'll not shame to tell you what it means.
HAMLET	Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?
HAMLET	As woman's love.
HAMLET	Wormwood, wormwood.
HAMLET	If she should break it now!
HAMLET	Madam, how like you this play?
HAMLET	O! but she'll keep her word.
HAMLET	No, no, they do but jest, poison in jest; no offence i' the world.
HAMLET	The Mouse-trap. Marry, how? Tropically. This play is the image of a murder done in Vienna: Gonzago is the duke's name; his wife, Baptista. You shall see anon; 'tis a knavish piece of work: but what of that? your majesty and we that have free souls, it touches us not: let the galled jade wince, our withers are unwrung.
HAMLET	This is one Lucianus, nephew to the king.
HAMLET	I could interpret between you and your love, if I could see the puppets dallying.
HAMLET	It would cost you a groaning to take off my edge.
HAMLET	So you must take your husbands. Begin, murderer; pox, leave thy damnable faces, and begin. Come; the croaking raven doth bellow for revenge.
HAMLET	He poisons him i' the garden for's estate. Hisname's Gonzago; the story is extant, and writ in very choice Italian. You shall see anon how the murderer gets the love of Gonzago's wife.
HAMLET	What! frighted with false fire?
HAMLET	Why, let the stricken deer go weep,
HAMLET	The hart ungalled play;
HAMLET	For some must watch, while some must sleep:
HAMLET	So runs the world away.
HAMLET	Would not this, sir, and a forest of feathers, if the rest of my fortunes turn Turk with me, with two Provincial roses on my razed shoes, get me a fellowship in a cry of players, sir?
HAMLET	A whole one, I.
HAMLET	For thou dost know, O Damon dear,
HAMLET	This realm dismantled was
HAMLET	Of Jove himself; and now reigns here
HAMLET	A very, very—pajock.
HAMLET	O good Horatio! I'll take the ghost's word for a thousand pound. Didst perceive?
HAMLET	Upon the talk of the poisoning?
HAMLET	Ah, ha! Come, some music! come, the recorders!
HAMLET	For if the king like not the comedy,
HAMLET	Why then, belike he likes it not, perdy.
HAMLET	Come, some music!
HAMLET	Sir, a whole history.
HAMLET	Ay, sir, what of him?
HAMLET	With drink, sir?
HAMLET	Your wisdom should show itself more richer to signify this to his doctor; for, for me to put him to his purgation would perhaps plunge him into far more choler.
HAMLET	I am tame, sir; pronounce.
HAMLET	You are welcome.
HAMLET	Sir, I cannot.
HAMLET	Make you a wholesome answer; my wit's diseased; but, sir, such answer as I can make, you shall command; or, rather, as you say, my mother: therefore no more, but to the matter: my mother, you say,—
HAMLET	O wonderful son, that can so astonish a mother! But is there no sequel at the heels of this mother's admiration? Impart.
HAMLET	We shall obey, were she ten times our mother. Have you any further trade with us?
HAMLET	So I do still, by these pickers and stealers.
HAMLET	Sir, I lack advancement.
HAMLET	Ay, sir, but 'While the grass grows,'—the proverb is something musty.
HAMLET	O! the recorders: let me see one. To withdraw with you: why do you go about to recover the wind of me, as if you would drive me into a toil?
HAMLET	I do not well understand that. Will you play upon this pipe?
HAMLET	I pray you.
HAMLET	I do beseech you.
HAMLET	'Tis as easy as lying; govern these ventages with your finger and thumb, give it breath with your mouth, and it will discourse most eloquent music. Look you, these are the stops.
HAMLET	Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of me. You would play upon me; you would seem to know my stops; you would pluck out the heart of my mystery; you would sound me from my lowest note to the top of my compass; and there is much music, excellent voice, in this little organ, yet cannot you make it speak. 'Sblood, do you think I am easier to be played on than a pipe? Call me what instrument you will, though you can fret me, you cannot play upon me.
HAMLET	God bless you, sir!
HAMLET	Do you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a camel?
HAMLET	Methinks it is like a weasel.
HAMLET	Or like a whale?
HAMLET	Then I will come to my mother by and by
HAMLET	They fool me to the top of my bent.  [Aloud.] I will come by and by.
HAMLET	By and by is easily said. Leave me, friends.
HAMLET	'Tis now the very witching time of night,
HAMLET	When churchyards yawn and hell itself breathes out
HAMLET	Contagion to this world: now could I drink hot blood,
HAMLET	And do such bitter business as the day
HAMLET	Would quake to look on. Soft! now to my mother.
HAMLET	O heart! lose not thy nature; let not ever
HAMLET	The soul of Nero enter this firm bosom;
HAMLET	Let me be cruel, not unnatural;
HAMLET	I will speak daggers to her, but use none;
HAMLET	My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites;
HAMLET	How in my words soever she be shent,
HAMLET	To give them seals never, my soul, consent!
HAMLET	Now might I do it pat, now he is praying;
HAMLET	And now I'll do't: and so he goes to heaven;
HAMLET	And so am I reveng'd. That would be scann'd:
HAMLET	A villain kills my father; and for that,
HAMLET	I, his sole son, do this same villain send
HAMLET	To heaven.
HAMLET	Why, this is hire and salary, not revenge.
HAMLET	He took my father grossly, full of bread,
HAMLET	With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May;
HAMLET	And how his audit stands who knows save heaven?
HAMLET	But in our circumstance and course of thought
HAMLET	'Tis heavy with him. And am I then reveng'd,
HAMLET	To take him in the purging of his soul,
HAMLET	When he is fit and season'd for his passage?
HAMLET	No.
HAMLET	Up, sword, and know thou a more horrid hent;
HAMLET	When he is drunk asleep, or in his rage,
HAMLET	Or in the incestuous pleasure of his bed,
HAMLET	At gaming, swearing, or about some act
HAMLET	That has no relish of salvation in't;
HAMLET	Then trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven,
HAMLET	And that his soul may be as damn'd and black
HAMLET	As hell, whereto it goes. My mother stays:
HAMLET	This physic but prolongs thy sickly days.
HAMLET	Mother, mother, mother!
HAMLET	Now, mother, what's the matter?
HAMLET	Mother, you have my father much offended.
HAMLET	Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue.
HAMLET	What's the matter now?
HAMLET	No, by the rood, not so:
HAMLET	You are the queen, your husband's brother's wife;
HAMLET	And,—would it were not so!—you are my mother.
HAMLET	Come, come, and sit you down; you shall not budge;
HAMLET	You go not, till I set you up a glass
HAMLET	Where you may see the inmost part of you.
HAMLET	How now! a rat? Dead, for a ducat, dead!
HAMLET	Nay, I know not: is it the king?
HAMLET	A bloody deed! almost as bad, good mother,
HAMLET	As kill a king, and marry with his brother.
HAMLET	Ay, lady, 'twas my word.
HAMLET	Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell!
HAMLET	I took thee for thy better; take thy fortune;
HAMLET	Thou find'st to be too busy is some danger.
HAMLET	Leave wringing of your hands: peace! sit you down,
HAMLET	And let me wring your heart; for so I shall
HAMLET	If it be made of penetrable stuff,
HAMLET	If damned custom have not brass'd it so
HAMLET	That it is proof and bulwark against sense
HAMLET	Such an act
HAMLET	That blurs the grace and blush of modesty,
HAMLET	Calls virtue hypocrite, takes off the rose
HAMLET	From the fair forehead of an innocent love
HAMLET	And sets a blister there, makes marriage vows
HAMLET	As false as dicers' oaths; O! such a deed
HAMLET	As from the body of contraction plucks
HAMLET	The very soul, and sweet religion makes
HAMLET	A rhapsody of words; heaven's face doth glow,
HAMLET	Yea, this solidity and compound mass,
HAMLET	With tristful visage, as against the doom,
HAMLET	Is thought-sick at the act.
HAMLET	Look here, upon this picture, and on this;
HAMLET	The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.
HAMLET	See, what a grace was seated on this brow;
HAMLET	Hyperion's curls, the front of Jove himself,
HAMLET	An eye like Mars, to threaten and command,
HAMLET	A station like the herald Mercury
HAMLET	New-lighted on a heaven-kissing hill,
HAMLET	A combination and a form indeed,
HAMLET	Where every god did seem to set his seal,
HAMLET	To give the world assurance of a man.
HAMLET	This was your husband: look you now, what follows.
HAMLET	Here is your husband; like a mildew'd ear,
HAMLET	Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?
HAMLET	Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,
HAMLET	And batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes?
HAMLET	You cannot call it love, for at your age
HAMLET	The hey-day in the blood is tame, it's humble,
HAMLET	And waits upon the judgment; and what judgment
HAMLET	Would step from this to this? Sense, sure, you have,
HAMLET	Else could you not have motion; but sure, that sense
HAMLET	Is apoplex'd; for madness would not err,
HAMLET	Nor sense to ecstasy was ne'er so thrall'd
HAMLET	But it reserv'd some quantity of choice,
HAMLET	To serve in such a difference. What devil was 't
HAMLET	That thus hath comen'd you at hoodman-blind?
HAMLET	Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,
HAMLET	Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
HAMLET	Or but a sickly part of one true sense
HAMLET	Could not so mope.
HAMLET	O shame! where is thy blush? Rebellious hell,
HAMLET	If thou canst mutine in a matron's bones,
HAMLET	To flaming youth let virtue be as wax,
HAMLET	And melt in her own fire: proclaim no shame
HAMLET	When the compulsive ardour gives the charge,
HAMLET	Since first itself as actively doth burn,
HAMLET	And reason panders will.
HAMLET	Nay, but to live
HAMLET	In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,
HAMLET	Stew'd in corruption, honeying and making love
HAMLET	Over the nasty sty,—
HAMLET	A murderer, and a villain;
HAMLET	A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe
HAMLET	Of your precedent lord; a vice of kings;
HAMLET	A cut-purse of the empire and the rule,
HAMLET	That from a shelf the precious diadem stole,
HAMLET	And put it in his pocket!
HAMLET	A king of shreds and patches,—
HAMLET	Save me, and hover o'er me with your wings,
HAMLET	You heavenly guards! What would your gracious figure?
HAMLET	Do you not come your tardy son to chide,
HAMLET	That, laps'd in time and passion, lets go by
HAMLET	The important acting of your dread command?
HAMLET	O! say.
HAMLET	How is it with you, lady?
HAMLET	On him, on him! Look you, how pale he glares!
HAMLET	His form and cause conjoin'd, preaching to stones,
HAMLET	Would make them capable. Do not look upon me;
HAMLET	Lest with this piteous action you convert
HAMLET	My stern effects: then what I have to do
HAMLET	Will want true colour; tears perchance for blood.
HAMLET	Do you see nothing there?
HAMLET	Nor did you nothing hear?
HAMLET	Why, look you there! look, how it steals away;
HAMLET	My father, in his habit as he liv'd;
HAMLET	Look! where he goes, even now, out at the portal.
HAMLET	Ecstasy!
HAMLET	My pulse, as yours, doth temperately keep time,
HAMLET	And makes as healthful music. It is not madness
HAMLET	That I have utter'd: bring me to the test,
HAMLET	And I the matter will re-word, which madness
HAMLET	Would gambol from. Mother, for love of grace,
HAMLET	Lay not that flattering unction to your soul,
HAMLET	That not your trespass but my madness speaks;
HAMLET	It will but skin and film the ulcerous place,
HAMLET	Whiles rank corruption, mining all within,
HAMLET	Infects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven;
HAMLET	Repent what's past; avoid what is to come;
HAMLET	And do not spread the compost on the weeds
HAMLET	To make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue;
HAMLET	For in the fatness of these pursy times
HAMLET	Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg,
HAMLET	Yea, curb and woo for leave to do him good.
HAMLET	O! throw away the worser part of it,
HAMLET	And live the purer with the other half.
HAMLET	Good night; but go not to mine uncle's bed;
HAMLET	Assume a virtue, if you have it not.
HAMLET	That monster, custom, who all sense doth eat,
HAMLET	Of habits devil, is angel yet in this,
HAMLET	That to the use of actions fair and good
HAMLET	He likewise gives a frock or livery,
HAMLET	That aptly is put on. Refrain to-night;
HAMLET	And that shall lend a kind of easiness
HAMLET	To the next abstinence: the next more easy;
HAMLET	For use almost can change the stamp of nature,
HAMLET	And master ev'n the devil or throw him out
HAMLET	With wondrous potency. Once more, goodnight:
HAMLET	And when you are desirous to be bless'd,
HAMLET	I'll blessing beg of you. For this same lord,
HAMLET	I do repent: but heaven hath pleas'd it so,
HAMLET	To punish me with this, and this with me,
HAMLET	That I must be their scourge and minister.
HAMLET	I will bestow him, and will answer well
HAMLET	The death I gave him. So, again, good-night.
HAMLET	I must be cruel only to be kind:
HAMLET	Thus bad begins and worse remains behind.
HAMLET	One word more, good lady.
HAMLET	Not this, by no means, that I bid you do:
HAMLET	Let the bloat king tempt you again to bed;
HAMLET	Pinch wanton on your cheek; call you his mouse;
HAMLET	And let him, for a pair of reechy kisses,
HAMLET	Or paddling in your neck with his damn'd fingers,
HAMLET	Make you to ravel all this matter out,
HAMLET	That I essentially am not in madness,
HAMLET	But mad in craft. 'Twere good you let him know;
HAMLET	For who that's but a queen, fair, sober, wise,
HAMLET	Would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib,
HAMLET	Such dear concernings hide? who would do so?
HAMLET	No, in despite of sense and secrecy,
HAMLET	Unpeg the basket on the house's top,
HAMLET	Let the birds fly, and, like the famous ape,
HAMLET	To try conclusions, in the basket creep,
HAMLET	And break your own neck down.
HAMLET	I must to England; you know that?
HAMLET	There's letters seal'd; and my two schoolfellows,
HAMLET	Whom I will trust as I will adders fang'd,
HAMLET	They bear the mandate; they must sweep my way,
HAMLET	And marshal me to knavery. Let it work;
HAMLET	For 'tis the sport to have the enginer
HAMLET	Hoist with his own petar: and it shall go hard
HAMLET	But I will delve one yard below their mines,
HAMLET	And blow them at the moon. O! 'tis most sweet,
HAMLET	When in one line two crafts directly meet.
HAMLET	This man shall set me packing;
HAMLET	I'll lug the guts into the neighbour room.
HAMLET	Mother, good-night. Indeed this counsellor
HAMLET	Is now most still, most secret, and most grave,
HAMLET	Who was in life a foolish prating knave.
HAMLET	Come, sir, to draw toward an end with you.
HAMLET	Good-night, mother.
HAMLET	Safely stowed.
HAMLET	What noise? who calls on Hamlet?
HAMLET	O! here they come.
HAMLET	Compounded it with dust, whereto 'tis kin.
HAMLET	Do not believe it.
HAMLET	That I can keep your counsel and not mine own. Besides, to be demanded of a sponge! what replication should be made by the son of a king?
HAMLET	Ay, sir, that soaks up the king's countenance, his rewards, his authorities. But such officers do the king best service in the end: he keeps them, like an ape, in the corner of his jaw; first mouthed, to be last swallowed: when he needs what you have gleaned, it is but squeezing you, and, sponge, you shall be dry again.
HAMLET	I am glad of it: a knavish speech sleeps in a foolish ear.
HAMLET	The body is with the king, but the king is not with the body. The king is a thing—
HAMLET	Of nothing: bring me to him. Hide fox, and all after.
HAMLET	At supper.
HAMLET	Not where he eats, but where he is eaten: a certain convocation of politic worms are e'en at him. Your worm is your only emperor for diet: we fat all creatures else to fat us, and we fat ourselves for maggots: your fat king and your lean beggar is but variable service; two dishes, but to one table: that's the end.
HAMLET	A man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a king, and eat of the fish that hath fed of that worm.
HAMLET	Nothing, but to show you how a king may go a progress through the guts of a beggar.
HAMLET	In heaven; send thither to see: if your messenger find him not there, seek him i' the other place yourself. But, indeed, if you find him not within this month, you shall nose him as you go up the stairs into the lobby.
HAMLET	He will stay till you come.
HAMLET	For England!
HAMLET	Good.
HAMLET	I see a cherub that sees them. But, come; for England! Farewell, dear mother.
HAMLET	My mother: father and mother is man and wife, man and wife is one flesh, and so, my mother. Come, for England!
HAMLET	Good sir, whose powers are these?
HAMLET	How purpos'd, sir, I pray you?
HAMLET	Who commands them, sir?
HAMLET	Goes it against the main of Poland, sir,
HAMLET	Or for some frontier?
HAMLET	Why, then the Polack never will defend it.
HAMLET	Two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats
HAMLET	Will not debate the question of this straw:
HAMLET	This is the imposthume of much wealth and peace,
HAMLET	That inward breaks, and shows no cause without
HAMLET	Why the man dies. I humbly thank you, sir.
HAMLET	I'll be with you straight. Go a little before.
HAMLET	How all occasions do inform against me,
HAMLET	And spur my dull revenge! What is a man,
HAMLET	If his chief good and market of his time
HAMLET	Be but to sleep and feed? a beast, no more.
HAMLET	Sure he that made us with such large discourse,
HAMLET	Looking before and after, gave us not
HAMLET	That capability and god-like reason
HAMLET	To fust in us unus'd. Now, whe'r it be
HAMLET	Bestial oblivion, or some craven scruple
HAMLET	Of thinking too precisely on the event,
HAMLET	A thought, which, quarter'd, hath but one part wisdom,
HAMLET	And ever three parts coward, I do not know
HAMLET	Why yet I live to say 'This thing's to do;'
HAMLET	Sith I have cause and will and strength and means
HAMLET	To do 't. Examples gross as earth exhort me:
HAMLET	Witness this army of such mass and charge
HAMLET	Led by a delicate and tender prince,
HAMLET	Whose spirit with divine ambition puff'd
HAMLET	Makes mouths at the invisible event,
HAMLET	Exposing what is mortal and unsure
HAMLET	To all that fortune, death and danger dare,
HAMLET	Even for an egg-shell. Rightly to be great
HAMLET	Is not to stir without great argument,
HAMLET	But greatly to find quarrel in a straw
HAMLET	When honour's at the stake. How stand I then,
HAMLET	That have a father kill'd, a mother stain'd,
HAMLET	Excitements of my reason and my blood,
HAMLET	And let all sleep, while, to my shame, I see
HAMLET	The imminent death of twenty thousand men,
HAMLET	That, for a fantasy and trick of fame,
HAMLET	Go to their graves like beds, fight for a plot
HAMLET	Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause,
HAMLET	Which is not tomb enough and continent
HAMLET	To hide the slaim? O! from this time forth,
HAMLET	My thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth!
HAMLET	Has this fellow no feeling of his business, that he sings at grave-making?
HAMLET	'Tis e'en so; the hand of little employment hath the daintier sense.
HAMLET	That skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once; how the knave jowls it to the ground, as if it were Cain's jaw-bone, that did the first murder! This might be the pate of a politician, which this ass now o'er-offices, one that would circumvent God, might it not?
HAMLET	Or of a courtier, which could say, 'Good morrow, sweet lord! How dost thou, good lord?' This might be my Lord Such-a-one, that praised my Lord Such-a-one's horse, when he meant to beg it, might it not?
HAMLET	Why, e'en so, and now my Lady Worm's; chapless, and knocked about the mazzard with a sexton's spade. Here's fine revolution, an we had the trick to see 't. Did these bones cost no more the breeding but to play at loggats with 'em? mine ache to think on 't.
HAMLET	There's another; why may not that be the skull of a lawyer? Where be his quiddities now, his quillets, his cases, his tenures, and his tricks? why does he suffer this rude knave now to knock him about the sconce with a dirty shovel, and will not tell him of his action of battery? Hum! This fellow might be in 's time a great buyer of land, with his statutes, his recognizances, his fines, his double vouchers, his recoveries; is this the fine of his fines, and the recovery of his recoveries, to have his fine pate full of fine dirt? will his vouchers vouch him no more of his purchases, and double ones too, than the length and breadth of a pair of indentures? The very conveyance of his lands will hardly lie in this box, and must the inheritor himself have no more, ha?
HAMLET	Is not parchment made of sheep-skins?
HAMLET	They are sheep and calves which seek out assurance in that. I will speak to this fellow. Whose grave's this, sir?
HAMLET	I think it be thine, indeed; for thou liest in 't.
HAMLET	Thou dost lie in 't, to be in 't and say it is thine: 'tis for the dead, not for the quick; therefore thou liest.
HAMLET	What man dost thou dig it for?
HAMLET	What woman, then?
HAMLET	Who is to be buried in 't?
HAMLET	How absolute the knave is! we must speak by the card, or equivocation will undo us. By the Lord, Horatio, these three years I have taken note of it; the age is grown so picked that the toe of the peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier, he galls his kibe. How long hast thou been a grave-maker?
HAMLET	How long is that since?
HAMLET	Ay, marry; why was he sent into England?
HAMLET	Why?
HAMLET	How came he mad?
HAMLET	How strangely?
HAMLET	Upon what ground?
HAMLET	How long will a man lie i' the earth ere he rot?
HAMLET	Why he more than another?
HAMLET	Whose was it?
HAMLET	Nay, I know not.
HAMLET	This!
HAMLET	Let me see.—
HAMLET	—Alas! poor Yorick. I knew him, Horatio; a fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy; he hath borne me on his back a thousand times; and now, how abhorred in my imagination it is! my gorge rises at it. Here hung those lips that I have kissed I know not how oft. Where be your gibes now? your gambols? your songs? your flashes of merriment, that were wont to set the table on a roar? Not one now, to mock your own grinning? quite chapfallen? Now get you to my lady's chamber, and tell her, let her paint an inch thick, to this favour she must come; make her laugh at that. Prithee, Horatio, tell me one thing.
HAMLET	Dost thou think Alexander looked o' this fashion i' the earth?
HAMLET	And smelt so? pah!
HAMLET	To what base uses we may return, Horatio! Why may not imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander, till he find it stopping a bung-hole?
HAMLET	No, faith, not a jot; but to follow him thither with modesty enough, and likelihood to lead it; as thus: Alexander died, Alexander was buried, Alexander returneth into dust; the dust is earth; of earth we make loam, and why of that loam, whereto he was converted, might they not stop a beer-barrel?
HAMLET	Imperious Cæsar, dead and turn'd to clay,
HAMLET	Might stop a hole to keep the wind away:
HAMLET	O! that that earth, which kept the world in awe,
HAMLET	Should patch a wall to expal the winter's flaw.
HAMLET	But soft! but soft! aside: here comes the king.
HAMLET	The queen, the courtiers: who is that they follow?
HAMLET	And with such maimed rites? This doth betoken
HAMLET	The corse they follow did with desperate hand
HAMLET	Fordo its own life; 'twas of some estate.
HAMLET	Couch we awhile, and mark.
HAMLET	That is Laertes,
HAMLET	A very noble youth: mark.
HAMLET	What! the fair Ophelia?
HAMLET	What is he whose grief
HAMLET	Bears such an emphasis? whose phrase of sorrow
HAMLET	Conjures the wandering stars, and makes them stand
HAMLET	Like wonder-wounded hearers? this is I,
HAMLET	Hamlet the Dane.
HAMLET	Thou pray'st not well.
HAMLET	I prithee, take thy fingers from my throat;
HAMLET	For though I am not splenetive and rash
HAMLET	Yet have I in me something dangerous,
HAMLET	Which let thy wisdom fear. Away thy hand!
HAMLET	Why, I will fight with him upon this theme
HAMLET	Until my eyelids will no longer wag.
HAMLET	I lov'd Ophelia: forty thousand brothers
HAMLET	Could not, with all their quantity of love,
HAMLET	Make up my sum. What wilt thou do for her?
HAMLET	'Swounds, show me what thou'lt do:
HAMLET	Woo't weep? woo't fight? woo't fast? woo't tear thyself?
HAMLET	Woo't drink up eisel? eat a crocodile?
HAMLET	I'll do't. Dost thou come here to whine?
HAMLET	To outface me with leaping in her grave?
HAMLET	Be buried quick with her, and so will I:
HAMLET	And, if thou prate of mountains, let them throw
HAMLET	Millions of acres on us, till our ground,
HAMLET	Singeing his pate against the burning zone,
HAMLET	Make Ossa like a wart! Nay, an thou'lt mouth,
HAMLET	I'll rant as well as thou.
HAMLET	Hear you, sir;
HAMLET	What is the reason that you use me thus?
HAMLET	I lov'd you ever: but it is no matter;
HAMLET	Let Hercules himself do what he may,
HAMLET	The cat will mew and dog will have his day.
HAMLET	So much for this, sir: now shall you see the other;
HAMLET	You do remember all the circumstance?
HAMLET	Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting
HAMLET	That would not let me sleep; methought I lay
HAMLET	Worse than the mutines in the bilboes. Rashly,—
HAMLET	And prais'd be rashness for it, let us know,
HAMLET	Our indiscretion sometimes serves us well
HAMLET	When our deep plots do pall; and that should teach us
HAMLET	There's a divinity that shapes our ends,
HAMLET	Rough-hew them how we will.
HAMLET	Up from my cabin,
HAMLET	My sea-gown scarf'd about me, in the dark
HAMLET	Grop'd I to find out them, had my desire,
HAMLET	Finger'd their packet, and in fine withdrew
HAMLET	To mine own room again; making so bold—
HAMLET	My fears forgetting manners—to unseal
HAMLET	Their grand commission; where I found, Horatio,
HAMLET	O royal knavery! an exact command,
HAMLET	Larded with many several sorts of reasons
HAMLET	Importing Denmark's health, and England's too,
HAMLET	With, ho! such bugs and goblins in my life,
HAMLET	That, on the supervise, no leisure bated,
HAMLET	No, not to stay the grinding of the axe,
HAMLET	My head should be struck off.
HAMLET	Here's the commission: read it at more leisure.
HAMLET	But wilt thou hear me how I did proceed?
HAMLET	Being thus be-netted round with villanies,—
HAMLET	Ere I could make a prologue to my brains
HAMLET	They had begun the play,—I sat me down,
HAMLET	Devis'd a new commission, wrote it fair;
HAMLET	I once did hold it, as our statists do,
HAMLET	A baseness to write fair, and labour'd much
HAMLET	How to forget that learning; but, sir, now
HAMLET	It did me yeoman's service. Wilt thou know
HAMLET	The effect of what I wrote?
HAMLET	An earnest conjuration from the king,
HAMLET	As England was his faithful tributary,
HAMLET	As love between them like the palm should flourish,
HAMLET	As peace should still her wheaten garland wear,
HAMLET	And stand a comma 'tween their amities,
HAMLET	And many such-like 'As'es of great charge,
HAMLET	That, on the view and knowing of these contents,
HAMLET	Without debatement further, more or less,
HAMLET	He should the bearers put to sudden death,
HAMLET	Not shriving-time allow'd.
HAMLET	Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.
HAMLET	I had my father's signet in my purse,
HAMLET	Which was the model of that Danish seal;
HAMLET	Folded the writ up in form of the other,
HAMLET	Subscrib'd it, gave't th' impression, plac'd it safely,
HAMLET	The changeling never known. Now, the next day
HAMLET	Was our sea-fight, and what to this was sequent
HAMLET	Thou know'st already.
HAMLET	Why, man, they did make love to this employment;
HAMLET	They are not near my conscience; their defeat
HAMLET	Does by their own insinuation grow.
HAMLET	'Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes
HAMLET	Between the pass and fell-incensed points
HAMLET	Of mighty opposites.
HAMLET	Does it not, thinks't thee, stand me now upon—
HAMLET	He that hath kill'd my king and whor'd my mother,
HAMLET	Popp'd in between the election and my hopes,
HAMLET	Thrown out his angle for my proper life,
HAMLET	And with such cozenage—is 't not perfect conscience
HAMLET	To quit him with this arm? and is 't not to be damn'd
HAMLET	To let this canker of our nature come
HAMLET	In further evil?
HAMLET	It will be short: the interim is mine;
HAMLET	And a man's life's no more than to say 'One.'
HAMLET	But I am very sorry, good Horatio,
HAMLET	That to Laertes I forgot myself;
HAMLET	For, by the image of my cause, I see
HAMLET	The portraiture of his: I'll count his favours:
HAMLET	But, sure, the bravery of his grief did put me
HAMLET	Into a towering passion.
HAMLET	I humbly thank you, sir.
HAMLET	Dost know this water-fly?
HAMLET	Thy state is the more gracious; for 'tis a vice to know him. He hath much land, and fertile: let a beast be lord of beasts, and his crib shall stand at the king's mess: 'tis a chough; but, as I say, spacious in the possession of dirt.
HAMLET	I will receive it, sir, with all diligence of spirit. Your bonnet to his right use; 'tis for the head.
HAMLET	No, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind is northerly.
HAMLET	But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my complexion.
HAMLET	I beseech you, remember—
HAMLET	Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you; though, I know, to divide him inventorially would dizzy the arithmetic of memory, and yet but yaw neither, in respect of his quick sail. But, in the verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of great article; and his infusion of such dearth and rareness, as, to make true diction of him, his semblable is his mirror; and who else would trace him, his umbrage, nothing more.
HAMLET	The concernancy, sir? why do we wrap the gentleman in our more rawer breath?
HAMLET	What imports the nomination of this gentleman?
HAMLET	Of him, sir.
HAMLET	I would you did, sir; in faith, if you did, it would not much approve me. Well, sir.
HAMLET	I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with him in excellence; but, to know a man well, were to know himself.
HAMLET	What's his weapon?
HAMLET	That's two of his weapons; but, well.
HAMLET	What call you the carriages?
HAMLET	The phrase would be more german to the matter, if we could carry cannon by our sides; I would it might be hangers till then. But, on; six Barbary horses against six French swords, their assigns, and three liberal-conceited carriages; that's the French bet against the Danish. Why is this 'imponed,' as you call it?
HAMLET	How if I answer no?
HAMLET	Sir, I will walk here in the hall; if it please his majesty, 'tis the breathing time of day with me; let the foils be brought, the gentleman willing, and the king hold his purpose, I will win for him an I can; if not, I will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits.
HAMLET	To this effect, sir; after what flourish your nature will.
HAMLET	Yours, yours.
HAMLET	He does well to commend it himself; there are no tongues else for 's turn.
HAMLET	He did comply with his dug before he sucked it. Thus has he—and many more of the same bevy, that I know the drossy age dotes on—only got the tune of the time and outward habit of encounter, a kind of yesty collection which carries them through and through the most fond and winnowed opinions; and do but blow them to their trial, the bubbles are out.
HAMLET	I am constant to my purposes; they follow the king's pleasure: if his fitness speaks, mine is ready; now, or whensoever, provided I be so able as now.
HAMLET	In happy time.
HAMLET	She well instructs me.
HAMLET	I do not think so; since he went into France, I have been in continual practice; I shall win at the odds. But thou wouldst not think how ill all 's here about my heart; but it is no matter.
HAMLET	It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of gain-giving as would perhaps trouble a woman.
HAMLET	Not a whit, we defy augury; there's a special providence in the fall of a sparrow. If it be now, 'tis not to come; if it be not to come, it will be now; if it be not now, yet it will come: the readiness is all. Since no man has aught of what he leaves, what is 't to leave betimes? Let be.
HAMLET	Give me your pardon, sir; I've done you wrong;
HAMLET	But pardon 't, as you are a gentleman.
HAMLET	This presence knows,
HAMLET	And you must needs have heard, how I am punish'd
HAMLET	With sore distraction. What I have done,
HAMLET	That might your nature, honour and exception
HAMLET	Roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.
HAMLET	Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes? Never Hamlet:
HAMLET	If Hamlet from himself be ta'en away,
HAMLET	And when he's not himself does wrong Laertes,
HAMLET	Then Hamlet does it not; Hamlet denies it.
HAMLET	Who does it then? His madness. If 't be so,
HAMLET	Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong'd;
HAMLET	His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy.
HAMLET	Sir, in this audience,
HAMLET	Let my disclaiming from a purpos'd evil
HAMLET	Free me so far in your most generous thoughts,
HAMLET	That I have shot mine arrow o'er the house,
HAMLET	And hurt my brother.
HAMLET	I embrace it freely;
HAMLET	And will this brother's wager frankly play.
HAMLET	Give us the foils. Come on.
HAMLET	I'll be your foil, Laertes; in mine ignorance
HAMLET	Your skill shall, like a star i' the darkest night,
HAMLET	Stick fiery off indeed.
HAMLET	No, by this hand.
HAMLET	Very well, my lord;
HAMLET	Your Grace hath laid the odds o' the weaker side.
HAMLET	This likes me well. These foils have all a length?
HAMLET	Come on, sir.
HAMLET	One.
HAMLET	Judgment.
HAMLET	I'll play this bout first; set it by awhile.
HAMLET	Come.—
HAMLET	Another hit; what say you?
HAMLET	Good madam!
HAMLET	I dare not drink yet, madam; by and by.
HAMLET	Come, for the third, Laertes. You but dally;
HAMLET	I pray you, pass with your best violence.
HAMLET	I am afeard you make a wanton of me.
HAMLET	Nay, come, again.
HAMLET	How does the queen?
HAMLET	O villany! Ho! let the door be lock'd:
HAMLET	Treachery! seek it out.
HAMLET	The point envenom'd tool—.
HAMLET	Then, venom, to thy work.
HAMLET	Here, thou incestuous, murderous, damned Dane,
HAMLET	Drink off this potion;—is thy union here?
HAMLET	Follow my mother.
HAMLET	Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee.
HAMLET	I am dead, Horatio. Wretched queen, adieu!
HAMLET	You that look pale and tremble at this chance,
HAMLET	That are but mutes or audience to this act,
HAMLET	Had I but time,—as this fell sergeant, death,
HAMLET	Is strict in his arrest,—O! I could tell you—
HAMLET	But let it be. Horatio, I am dead;
HAMLET	Thou liv'st; report me and my cause aright
HAMLET	To the unsatisfied.
HAMLET	As thou'rt a man,
HAMLET	Give me the cup: let go; by heaven, I'll have 't.
HAMLET	O God! Horatio, what a wounded name,
HAMLET	Things standing thus unknown, shall live behind me.
HAMLET	If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart,
HAMLET	Absent thee from felicity awhile,
HAMLET	And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,
HAMLET	To tell my story.
HAMLET	What war-like noise is this?
HAMLET	O! I die, Horatio;
HAMLET	The potent poison quite o'er-crows my spirit:
HAMLET	I cannot live to hear the news from England,
HAMLET	But I do prophesy the election lights
HAMLET	On Fortinbras: he has my dying voice;
HAMLET	So tell him, with the occurrents, more and less,
HAMLET	Which have solicited—The rest is silence.
HORATIO	Friends to this ground.
HORATIO	A piece of him.
HORATIO	Tush, tush! 'twill not appear.
HORATIO	Well, sit we down,
HORATIO	And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.
HORATIO	Most like: it harrows me with fear and wonder.
HORATIO	What art thou that usurp'st this time of night,
HORATIO	Together with that fair and war-like form
HORATIO	In which the majesty of buried Denmark
HORATIO	Did sometimes march? by heaven I charge thee, speak!
HORATIO	Stay! speak, speak! I charge thee, speak!
HORATIO	Before my God, I might not this believe
HORATIO	Without the sensible and true avouch
HORATIO	Of mine own eyes.
HORATIO	As thou-art to thyself:
HORATIO	Such was the very armour he had on
HORATIO	When he the ambitious Norway combated;
HORATIO	So frown'd he once, when, in an angry parle,
HORATIO	He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
HORATIO	'Tis strange.
HORATIO	In what particular thought to work I know not;
HORATIO	But in the gross and scope of my opinion,
HORATIO	This bodes some strange eruption to our state.
HORATIO	That can I;
HORATIO	At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
HORATIO	Whose image even but now appear'd to us,
HORATIO	Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
HORATIO	Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,
HORATIO	Dar'd to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet—
HORATIO	For so this side of our known world esteem'd him—
HORATIO	Did slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact,
HORATIO	Well ratified by law and heraldry,
HORATIO	Did forfeit with his life all those his lands
HORATIO	Which he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror;
HORATIO	Against the which, a moiety competent
HORATIO	Was gaged by our king; which had return'd
HORATIO	To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
HORATIO	Had he been vanquisher; as, by the same covenant,
HORATIO	And carriage of the article design'd,
HORATIO	His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
HORATIO	Of unimproved mettle hot and full,
HORATIO	Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there
HORATIO	Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,
HORATIO	For food and diet, to some enterprise
HORATIO	That hath a stomach in 't; which is no other—
HORATIO	As it doth well appear unto our state—
HORATIO	But to recover of us, by strong hand
HORATIO	And terms compulsative, those foresaid lands
HORATIO	So by his father lost. And this, I take it,
HORATIO	Is the main motive of our preparations,
HORATIO	The source of this our watch and the chief head
HORATIO	Of this post-haste and romage in the land.
HORATIO	A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
HORATIO	In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
HORATIO	A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
HORATIO	The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead
HORATIO	Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets;
HORATIO	As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,
HORATIO	Disasters in the sun; and the moist star
HORATIO	Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands
HORATIO	Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse;
HORATIO	And even the like precurse of fierce events,
HORATIO	As harbingers preceding still the fates
HORATIO	And prologue to the omen coming on,
HORATIO	Have heaven and earth together demonstrated
HORATIO	Unto our climatures and countrymen.
HORATIO	But, soft! behold! lo! where it comes again.
HORATIO	I'll cross it, though it blast me. Stay, illusion!
HORATIO	If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,
HORATIO	Speak to me:
HORATIO	If there be any good thing to be done,
HORATIO	That may to thee do ease and grace to me,
HORATIO	Speak to me:
HORATIO	If thou art privy to thy country's fate,
HORATIO	Which happily foreknowing may avoid,
HORATIO	O! speak;
HORATIO	Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
HORATIO	Extorted treasure in the womb of earth,
HORATIO	For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,
HORATIO	Speak of it: stay, and speak! Stop it, Marcellus.
HORATIO	Do, if it will not stand.
HORATIO	'Tis here!
HORATIO	And then it started like a guilty thing
HORATIO	Upon a fearful summons. I have heard,
HORATIO	The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,
HORATIO	Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
HORATIO	Awake the god of day; and at his warning,
HORATIO	Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
HORATIO	The extravagant and erring spirit hies
HORATIO	To his confine; and of the truth herein
HORATIO	This present object made probation.
HORATIO	So have I heard and do in part believe it.
HORATIO	But, look, the morn in russet mantle clad,
HORATIO	Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastern hill;
HORATIO	Break we our watch up; and by my advice
HORATIO	Let us impart what we have seen to-night
HORATIO	Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,
HORATIO	This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.
HORATIO	Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
HORATIO	As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?
HORATIO	Hail to your lordship!
HORATIO	The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.
HORATIO	A truant disposition, good my lord.
HORATIO	My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.
HORATIO	Indeed, my lord, it follow'd hard upon.
HORATIO	O! where, my lord?
HORATIO	I saw him once; he was a goodly king.
HORATIO	My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.
HORATIO	My lord, the king your father.
HORATIO	Season your admiration for a while
HORATIO	With an attent ear, till I may deliver,
HORATIO	Upon the witness of these gentlemen,
HORATIO	This marvel to you.
HORATIO	Two nights together had these gentlemen,
HORATIO	Marcellus and Bernardo, on their watch,
HORATIO	In the dead vast and middle of the night,
HORATIO	Been thus encounter'd: a figure like your father,
HORATIO	Armed at points exactly, cap-a-pe,
HORATIO	Appears before them, and with solemn march
HORATIO	Goes slow and stately by them: thrice he walk'd
HORATIO	By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,
HORATIO	Within his truncheon's length; whilst they, distill'd
HORATIO	Almost to jelly with the act of fear,
HORATIO	Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me
HORATIO	In dreadful secrecy impart they did,
HORATIO	And I with them the third night kept the watch;
HORATIO	Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,
HORATIO	Form of the thing, each word made true and good,
HORATIO	The apparition comes. I knew your father;
HORATIO	These hands are not more like.
HORATIO	My lord, I did;
HORATIO	But answer made it none; yet once methought
HORATIO	It lifted up its head and did address
HORATIO	Itself to motion, like as it would speak;
HORATIO	But even then the morning cock crew loud,
HORATIO	And at the sound it shrunk in haste away
HORATIO	And vanish'd from our sight.
HORATIO	As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;
HORATIO	And we did think it writ down in our duty
HORATIO	To let you know of it.
HORATIO	O yes! my lord; he wore his beaver up.
HORATIO	A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.
HORATIO	Nay, very pale.
HORATIO	Most constantly.
HORATIO	It would have much amaz'd you.
HORATIO	While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.
HORATIO	Not when I saw it.
HORATIO	It was, as I have seen it in his life,
HORATIO	A sable silver'd.
HORATIO	I warrant it will.
HORATIO	It is a nipping and an eager air.
HORATIO	I think it lacks of twelve.
HORATIO	Indeed? I heard it not: then it draws near the season
HORATIO	Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.
HORATIO	What does this mean, my lord?
HORATIO	Is it a custom?
HORATIO	Look, my lord, it comes.
HORATIO	It beckons you to go away with it,
HORATIO	As if it some impartment did desire
HORATIO	To you alone.
HORATIO	No, by no means.
HORATIO	Do not, my lord.
HORATIO	What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,
HORATIO	Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff
HORATIO	That beetles o'er his base into the sea,
HORATIO	And there assume some other horrible form,
HORATIO	Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason
HORATIO	And draw you into madness? think of it;
HORATIO	The very place puts toys of desperation,
HORATIO	Without more motive, into every brain
HORATIO	That looks so many fathoms to the sea
HORATIO	And hears it roar beneath.
HORATIO	Be rul'd; you shall not go.
HORATIO	He wares desperate with imagination.
HORATIO	Have after. To what issue will this come?
HORATIO	Heaven will direct it.
HORATIO	My lord! my lord!
HORATIO	Heaven secure him!
HORATIO	Hillo, ho, ho, my lord!
HORATIO	What news, my lord?
HORATIO	Good my lord, tell it.
HORATIO	Not I, my lord, by heaven!
HORATIO	Ay, by heaven, my lord.
HORATIO	There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave,
HORATIO	To tell us this.
HORATIO	These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.
HORATIO	There's no offence, my lord.
HORATIO	What is't, my lord? we will.
HORATIO	My lord, we will not.
HORATIO	In faith,
HORATIO	My lord, not I.
HORATIO	Propose the oath, my lord.
HORATIO	O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!
HORATIO	Here, sweet lord, at your service.
HORATIO	O! my dear lord,—
HORATIO	Well, my lord:
HORATIO	If he steal aught the whilst this play is playing,
HORATIO	And 'scape detecting, I will pay the theft.
HORATIO	Half a share.
HORATIO	You might have rimed.
HORATIO	Very well, my lord.
HORATIO	I did very well note him.
HORATIO	'Twere good she were spoken with, for she may strew
HORATIO	Dangerous conjectures in ill-breeding minds.
HORATIO	What are they that would speak with me?
HORATIO	Let them come in.
HORATIO	I do not know from what part of the world
HORATIO	I should be greeted, if not from Lord Hamlet.
HORATIO	Let him bless thee too.
HORATIO	Horatio, when thou shalt have overlooked this, give these fellows some means to the king: they have letters for him. Ere we were two days old at sea, a pirate of very war-like appointment gave us chase. Finding ourselves too slow of sail, we put on a compelled valour; in the grapple I boarded them: on the instant they got clear of our ship, so I alone became their prisoner. They have dealt with me like thieves of mercy, but they knew what they did; I am to do a good turn for them. Let the king have the letters I have sent; and repair thou to me with as much haste as thou wouldst fly death. I have words to speak in thine ear will make thee dumb; yet are they much too light for the bore of the matter. These good fellows will bring thee where I am. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern hold their course for England: of them I have much to tell thee. Farewell.
HORATIO	He that thou knowest thine,
HORATIO	Come, I will give you way for these your letters;
HORATIO	And do 't the speedier, that you may direct me
HORATIO	To him from whom you brought them.
HORATIO	Custom hath made it in him a property of easiness.
HORATIO	It might, my lord.
HORATIO	Ay, my lord.
HORATIO	Not a jot more, my lord.
HORATIO	Ay, my lord, and of calf-skins too.
HORATIO	What's that, my lord?
HORATIO	E'en so.
HORATIO	E'en so, my lord.
HORATIO	'Twere to consider too curiously, to consider so.
HORATIO	Good my lord, be quiet.
HORATIO	Remember it, my lord?
HORATIO	That is most certain.
HORATIO	Is 't possible?
HORATIO	I beseech you.
HORATIO	Ay, good my lord.
HORATIO	How was this seal'd?
HORATIO	So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to 't.
HORATIO	Why, what a king is this!
HORATIO	It must be shortly known to him from England
HORATIO	What is the issue of the business there.
HORATIO	Peace! who comes here?
HORATIO	No, my good lord.
HORATIO	Is 't not possible to understand in another tongue? You will do 't, sir, really.
HORATIO	His purse is empty already; all 's golden words are spent.
HORATIO	I knew you must be edified by the margent, ere you had done.
HORATIO	This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.
HORATIO	You will lose this wager, my lord.
HORATIO	Nay, good my lord,—
HORATIO	If your mind dislike any thing, obey it; I will forestal their repair hither, and say you are not fit.
HORATIO	They bleed on both sides. How is it, my lord?
HORATIO	Never believe it;
HORATIO	I am more an antique Roman than a Dane:
HORATIO	Here's yet some liquor left.
HORATIO	Now cracks a noble heart. Good-night, sweet prince,
HORATIO	And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!
HORATIO	Why does the drum come hither?
HORATIO	What is it ye would see?
HORATIO	If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.
HORATIO	Not from his mouth,
HORATIO	Had it the ability of life to thank you:
HORATIO	He never gave commandment for their death.
HORATIO	But since, so jump upon this bloody question,
HORATIO	You from the Polack wars, and you from England,
HORATIO	Are here arriv'd, give order that these bodies
HORATIO	High on a stage be placed to the view;
HORATIO	And let me speak to the yet unknowing world
HORATIO	How these things came about: so shall you hear
HORATIO	Of carnal, bloody, and unnatural acts,
HORATIO	Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters;
HORATIO	Of deaths put on by cunning and forc'd cause,
HORATIO	And, in this upshot, purposes mistook
HORATIO	Fall'n on the inventors' heads; all this can I
HORATIO	Truly deliver.
HORATIO	Of that I shall have also cause to speak,
HORATIO	And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more:
HORATIO	But let this same be presently perform'd,
HORATIO	Even while men's minds are wild, lest more mischance
HORATIO	On plots and errors happen.
JULIET	How now! who calls?
JULIET	Madam, I am here.
JULIET	What is your will?
JULIET	And stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say I.
JULIET	It is an honour that I dream not of.
JULIET	I'll look to like, if looking liking move;
JULIET	But no more deep will I endart mine eye
JULIET	Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.
JULIET	Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,
JULIET	Which mannerly devotion shows in this;
JULIET	For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,
JULIET	And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.
JULIET	Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
JULIET	Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.
JULIET	Then have my lips the sin that they have took.
JULIET	You kiss by the book.
JULIET	Come hither, nurse. What is yond gentleman?
JULIET	What's he that now is going out of door?
JULIET	What's he, that follows there, that would not dance?
JULIET	Go, ask his name.—If he be married,
JULIET	My grave is like to be my wedding bed.
JULIET	My only love sprung from my only hate!
JULIET	Too early seen unknown, and known too late!
JULIET	Prodigious birth of love it is to me,
JULIET	That I must love a loathed enemy.
JULIET	A rime I learn'd even now
JULIET	Of one I danc'd withal.
JULIET	Ay me!
JULIET	O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?
JULIET	Deny thy father, and refuse thy name;
JULIET	Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,
JULIET	And I'll no longer be a Capulet.
JULIET	'Tis but thy name that is my enemy;
JULIET	Thou art thyself though, not a Montague.
JULIET	What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot,
JULIET	Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part
JULIET	Belonging to a man. O! be some other name:
JULIET	What's in a name? that which we call a rose
JULIET	By any other name would smell as sweet;
JULIET	So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,
JULIET	Retain that dear perfection which he owes
JULIET	Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name;
JULIET	And for that name, which is no part of thee,
JULIET	Take all myself.
JULIET	What man art thou, that, thus bescreen'd in night,
JULIET	So stumblest on my counsel?
JULIET	My ears have not yet drunk a hundred words
JULIET	Of that tongue's uttering, yet I know the sound:
JULIET	Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague?
JULIET	How cam'st thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?
JULIET	The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,
JULIET	And the place death, considering who thou art,
JULIET	If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
JULIET	If they do see thee they will murder thee.
JULIET	I would not for the world they saw thee here.
JULIET	By whose direction found'st thou out this place?
JULIET	Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face,
JULIET	Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
JULIET	For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night.
JULIET	Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny
JULIET	What I have spoke: but farewell compliment!
JULIET	Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay;'
JULIET	And I will take thy word; yet, if thou swear'st,
JULIET	Thou mayst prove false; at lovers' perjuries,
JULIET	They say, Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo!
JULIET	If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:
JULIET	Or if thou think'st I am too quickly won,
JULIET	I'll frown and be perverse and say thee nay,
JULIET	So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.
JULIET	In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,
JULIET	And therefore thou mayst think my haviour light:
JULIET	But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true
JULIET	Than those that have more cunning to be strange.
JULIET	I should have been more strange, I must confess,
JULIET	But that thou over-heard'st, ere I was 'ware,
JULIET	My true love's passion: therefore pardon me,
JULIET	And not impute this yielding to light love,
JULIET	Which the dark night hath so discovered.
JULIET	O! swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon,
JULIET	That monthly changes in her circled orb,
JULIET	Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.
JULIET	Do not swear at all;
JULIET	Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,
JULIET	Which is the god of my idolatry,
JULIET	And I'll believe thee.
JULIET	Well, do not swear. Although I joy in thee,
JULIET	I have no joy of this contract to-night:
JULIET	It is too rash, too unadvis'd, too sudden;
JULIET	Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be
JULIET	Ere one can say it lightens. Sweet, good-night!
JULIET	This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,
JULIET	May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.
JULIET	Good-night, good-night! as sweet repose and rest
JULIET	Come to thy heart as that within my breast!
JULIET	What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?
JULIET	I gave thee mine before thou didst request it;
JULIET	And yet I would it were to give again.
JULIET	But to be frank, and give it thee again.
JULIET	And yet I wish but for the thing I have:
JULIET	My bounty is as boundless as the sea,
JULIET	My love as deep; the more I give to thee,
JULIET	The more I have, for both are infinite.
JULIET	I hear some noise within; dear love, adieu!
JULIET	Anon, good nurse! Sweet Montague, be true.
JULIET	Stay but a little, I will come again.
JULIET	Three words, dear Romeo, and good-night indeed.
JULIET	If that thy bent of love be honourable,
JULIET	Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow,
JULIET	By one that I'll procure to come to thee,
JULIET	Where, and what time, thou wilt perform the rite;
JULIET	And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay,
JULIET	And follow thee my lord throughout the world.
JULIET	I come, anon.—But if thou mean'st not well,
JULIET	I do beseech thee,—
JULIET	By and by; I come:—
JULIET	To cease thy suit, and leave me to my grief:
JULIET	To-morrow will I send.
JULIET	A thousand times good-night!
JULIET	Hist! Romeo, hist! O! for a falconer's voice,
JULIET	To lure this tassel-gentle back again.
JULIET	Bondage is hoarse, and may not speak aloud,
JULIET	Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,
JULIET	And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine,
JULIET	With repetition of my Romeo's name.
JULIET	Romeo!
JULIET	At what o'clock to-morrow
JULIET	Shall I send to thee?
JULIET	I will not fail; 'tis twenty years till then.
JULIET	I have forgot why I did call thee back.
JULIET	I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,
JULIET	Remembering how I love thy company.
JULIET	'Tis almost morning; I would have thee gone;
JULIET	And yet no further than a wanton's bird,
JULIET	Who lets it hop a little from her hand,
JULIET	Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,
JULIET	And with a silk thread plucks it back again,
JULIET	So loving-jealous of his liberty.
JULIET	Sweet, so would I:
JULIET	Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.
JULIET	Good-night, good-night! parting is such sweet sorrow
JULIET	That I shall say good-night till it be morrow.
JULIET	The clock struck nine when I did send the nurse;
JULIET	In half an hour she promis'd to return.
JULIET	Perchance she cannot meet him: that's not so.
JULIET	O! she is lame: love's heralds should be thoughts,
JULIET	Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams,
JULIET	Driving back shadows over lowering hills:
JULIET	Therefore do nimble-pinion'd doves draw Love,
JULIET	And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.
JULIET	Now is the sun upon the highmost hill
JULIET	Of this day's journey, and from nine till twelve
JULIET	Is three long hours, yet she is not come.
JULIET	Had she affections, and warm youthful blood,
JULIET	She'd be as swift in motion as a ball;
JULIET	My words would bandy her to my sweet love,
JULIET	And his to me:
JULIET	But old folks, many feign as they were dead;
JULIET	Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.
JULIET	O God! she comes. O honey nurse! what news?
JULIET	Hast thou met with him? Send thy man away.
JULIET	Now, good sweet nurse; O Lord! why look'st thou sad?
JULIET	Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily;
JULIET	If good, thou sham'st the music of sweet news
JULIET	By playing it to me with so sour a face.
JULIET	I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news.
JULIET	Nay, come, I pray thee, speak; good, good nurse, speak.
JULIET	How art thou out of breath when thou hast breath
JULIET	To say to me that thou art out of breath?
JULIET	The excuse that thou dost make in this delay
JULIET	Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.
JULIET	Is thy news good, or bad? answer to that;
JULIET	Say either, and I'll stay the circumstance:
JULIET	Let me be satisfied, is 't good or bad?
JULIET	No, no: but all this did I know before.
JULIET	What says he of our marriage? what of that?
JULIET	I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.
JULIET	Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?
JULIET	Where is my mother! why, she is within;
JULIET	Where should she be? How oddly thou repliest:
JULIET	'Your love says, like an honest gentleman,
JULIET	Where is your mother?'
JULIET	Here's such a coil! come, what says Romeo?
JULIET	I have.
JULIET	Hie to high fortune! Honest nurse, farewell.
JULIET	Good even to my ghostly confessor.
JULIET	As much to him, else are his thanks too much.
JULIET	Conceit, more rich in matter than in words,
JULIET	Brags of his substance, not of ornament:
JULIET	They are but beggars that can count their worth;
JULIET	But my true love is grown to such excess
JULIET	I cannot sum up half my sum of wealth.
JULIET	Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,
JULIET	Towards Phœbus' lodging; such a waggoner
JULIET	As Phæthon would whip you to the west,
JULIET	And bring in cloudy night immediately.
JULIET	Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night!
JULIET	That runaway's eyes may wink, and Romeo
JULIET	Leap to these arms, untalk'd of and unseen!
JULIET	Lovers can see to do their amorous rites
JULIET	By their own beauties; or, if love be blind,
JULIET	It best agrees with night. Come, civil night,
JULIET	Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,
JULIET	And learn me how to lose a winning match,
JULIET	Play'd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods:
JULIET	Hood my unmann'd blood, bating in my cheeks,
JULIET	With thy black mantle; till strange love, grown bold,
JULIET	Think true love acted simple modesty.
JULIET	Come, night! come, Romeo! come, thou day in night!
JULIET	For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night,
JULIET	Whiter than new snow on a raven's back.
JULIET	Come, gentle night; come, loving, black-brow'd night,
JULIET	Give me my Romeo: and, when he shall die,
JULIET	Take him and cut him out in little stars,
JULIET	And he will make the face of heaven so fine
JULIET	That all the world will be in love with night,
JULIET	And pay no worship to the garish sun.
JULIET	O! I have bought the mansion of a love,
JULIET	But not possess'd it, and, though I am sold,
JULIET	Not yet enjoy'd. So tedious is this day
JULIET	As is the night before some festival
JULIET	To an impatient child that hath new robes
JULIET	And may not wear them. O! here comes my nurse,
JULIET	And she brings news; and every tongue that speaks
JULIET	But Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence.
JULIET	Now nurse, what news? What hast thou there? the cords
JULIET	That Romeo bade thee fetch?
JULIET	Ah me! what news? why dost thou wring thy hands?
JULIET	Can heaven be so envious?
JULIET	What devil art thou that dost torment me thus?
JULIET	This torture should be roar'd in dismal hell.
JULIET	Hath Romeo slain himself? say thou but 'I,'
JULIET	And that bare vowel, 'I,' shall poison more
JULIET	Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice:
JULIET	I am not I, if there be such an 'I;'
JULIET	Or those eyes shut that make thee answer 'I.'
JULIET	If he be slain, say 'I;' or if not 'no:'
JULIET	Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe.
JULIET	O break, my heart!—poor bankrupt, break at once!
JULIET	To prison, eyes, ne'er look on liberty!
JULIET	Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here;
JULIET	And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier!
JULIET	What storm is this that blows so contrary?
JULIET	Is Romeo slaughter'd, and is Tybalt dead?
JULIET	My dearest cousin, and my dearer lord?
JULIET	Then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom!
JULIET	For who is living if those two are gone?
JULIET	O God! did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?
JULIET	O serpent heart, hid with a flowering face!
JULIET	Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?
JULIET	Beautiful tyrant! fiend angelical!
JULIET	Dove-feather'd raven! wolvish-ravening lamb!
JULIET	Despised substance of divinest show!
JULIET	Just opposite to what thou justly seem'st;
JULIET	A damned saint, an honourable villain!
JULIET	O, nature! what hadst thou to do in hell
JULIET	When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend
JULIET	In mortal paradise of such sweet flesh?
JULIET	Was ever book containing such vile matter
JULIET	So fairly bound? O! that deceit should dwell
JULIET	In such a gorgeous palace.
JULIET	Blister'd be thy tongue
JULIET	For such a wish! he was not born to shame:
JULIET	Upon his brow shame is asham'd to sit;
JULIET	For 'tis a throne where honour may be crown'd
JULIET	Sole monarch of the universal earth.
JULIET	O! what a beast was I to chide at him.
JULIET	Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?
JULIET	Ah! poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name,
JULIET	When I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it?
JULIET	But, wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?
JULIET	That villain cousin would have kill'd my husband:
JULIET	Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring;
JULIET	Your tributary drops belong to woe,
JULIET	Which you, mistaking, offer up to joy.
JULIET	My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain;
JULIET	And Tybalt's dead, that would have slain my husband:
JULIET	All this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?
JULIET	Some word there was, worser than Tybalt's death,
JULIET	That murder'd me: I would forget it fain;
JULIET	But O! it presses to my memory,
JULIET	Like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds.
JULIET	'Tybalt is dead, and Romeo banished!'
JULIET	That 'banished,' that one word 'banished,'
JULIET	Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt's death
JULIET	Was woe enough, if it had ended there:
JULIET	Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship,
JULIET	And needly will be rank'd with other griefs,
JULIET	Why follow'd not, when she said 'Tybalt's dead,'
JULIET	Thy father, or thy mother, nay, or both,
JULIET	Which modern lamentation might have mov'd?
JULIET	But with a rearward following Tybalt's death,
JULIET	'Romeo is banished!' to speak that word
JULIET	Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,
JULIET	All slain, all dead: 'Romeo is banished!'
JULIET	There is no end, no limit, measure, bound
JULIET	In that word's death; no words can that woe sound.—
JULIET	Where is my father and my mother, nurse?
JULIET	Wash they his wounds with tears: mine shall be spent,
JULIET	When theirs are dry, for Romeo's banishment.
JULIET	Take up those cords. Poor ropes, you are beguil'd,
JULIET	Both you and I, for Romeo is exil'd:
JULIET	He made you for a highway to my bed,
JULIET	But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed.
JULIET	Come, cords; come, nurse; I'll to my wedding bed;
JULIET	And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead!
JULIET	O! find him; give this ring to my true knight,
JULIET	And bid him come to take his last farewell.
JULIET	Wilt thou be gone? it is not yet near day:
JULIET	It was the nightingale, and not the lark,
JULIET	That pierc'd the fearful hollow of thine ear;
JULIET	Nightly she sings on you pomegranate tree:
JULIET	Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.
JULIET	Yon light is not daylight, I know it, I:
JULIET	It is some meteor that the sun exhales,
JULIET	To be to thee this night a torch-bearer,
JULIET	And light thee on thy way to Mantua:
JULIET	Therefore stay yet; thou need'st not to be gone.
JULIET	It is, it is; hie hence, be gone, away!
JULIET	It is the lark that sings so out of tune,
JULIET	Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.
JULIET	Some say the lark makes sweet division;
JULIET	This doth not so, for she divideth us:
JULIET	Some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes;
JULIET	O! now I would they had chang'd voices too,
JULIET	Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,
JULIET	Hunting thee hence with hunts-up to the day.
JULIET	O! now be gone; more light and light it grows.
JULIET	Nurse!
JULIET	Then, window, let day in, and let life out.
JULIET	Art thou gone so? my lord, my love, my friend!
JULIET	I must hear from thee every day in the hour,
JULIET	For in a minute there are many days:
JULIET	O! by this count I shall be much in years
JULIET	Ere I again behold my Romeo.
JULIET	O! think'st thou we shall ever meet again?
JULIET	O God! I have an ill-divining soul:
JULIET	Methinks I see thee, now thou art so low,
JULIET	As one dead in the bottom of a tomb:
JULIET	Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.
JULIET	O fortune, fortune! all men call thee fickle:
JULIET	If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him
JULIET	That is renown'd for faith? Be fickle, fortune;
JULIET	For then, I hope, thou wilt not keep him long,
JULIET	But send him back.
JULIET	Who is't that calls? is it my lady mother?
JULIET	Is she not down so late, or up so early?
JULIET	What unaccustom'd cause procures her hither?
JULIET	Madam, I am not well.
JULIET	Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.
JULIET	Feeling so the loss,
JULIET	I cannot choose but ever weep the friend.
JULIET	What villain, madam?
JULIET	Villain and he be many miles asunder.
JULIET	God pardon him! I do, with all my heart;
JULIET	And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.
JULIET	Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands.
JULIET	Would none but I might venge my cousin's death!
JULIET	Indeed, I never shall be satisfied
JULIET	With Romeo, till I behold him—dead—
JULIET	Is my poor heart so for a kinsman vex'd:
JULIET	Madam, if you could find out but a man
JULIET	To bear a poison, I would temper it,
JULIET	That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof,
JULIET	Soon sleep in quiet. O! how my heart abhors
JULIET	To hear him nam'd, and cannot come to him,
JULIET	To wreak the love I bore my cousin Tybalt
JULIET	Upon his body that hath slaughter'd him.
JULIET	And joy comes well in such a needy time:
JULIET	What are they, I beseech your ladyship?
JULIET	Madam, in happy time, what day is that?
JULIET	Now, by Saint Peter's church, and Peter too,
JULIET	He shall not make me there a joyful bride.
JULIET	I wonder at this haste; that I must wed
JULIET	Ere he that should be husband comes to woo.
JULIET	I pray you, tell my lord and father, madam,
JULIET	I will not marry yet; and, when I do, I swear,
JULIET	It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,
JULIET	Rather than Paris. These are news indeed!
JULIET	Not proud, you have; but thankful, that you have:
JULIET	Proud can I never be of what I hate;
JULIET	But thankful even for hate, that is meant love.
JULIET	Good father, I beseech you on my knees,
JULIET	Hear me with patience but to speak a word.
JULIET	Is there no pity sitting in the clouds,
JULIET	That sees into the bottom of my grief?
JULIET	O! sweet my mother, cast me not away:
JULIET	Delay this marriage for a month, a week;
JULIET	Or, if you do not, make the bridal bed
JULIET	In that dim monument where Tybalt lies.
JULIET	O God! O nurse! how shall this be prevented?
JULIET	My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven;
JULIET	How shall that faith return again to earth,
JULIET	Unless that husband send it me from heaven
JULIET	By leaving earth? comfort me, counsel me.
JULIET	Alack, alack! that heaven should practise stratagems
JULIET	Upon so soft a subject as myself!
JULIET	What sayst thou? hast thou not a word of joy?
JULIET	Some comfort, nurse?
JULIET	Speakest thou from thy heart?
JULIET	Amen!
JULIET	Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much.
JULIET	Go in; and tell my lady I am gone,
JULIET	Having displeas'd my father, to Laurence' cell,
JULIET	To make confession and to be absolv'd.
JULIET	Ancient damnation! O most wicked fiend!
JULIET	Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn,
JULIET	Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue
JULIET	Which she hath prais'd him with above compare
JULIET	So many thousand times? Go, counsellor;
JULIET	Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain.
JULIET	I'll to the friar, to know his remedy:
JULIET	If all else fail, myself have power to die.
JULIET	That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.
JULIET	What must be shall be.
JULIET	To answer that, I should confess to you.
JULIET	I will confess to you that I love him.
JULIET	If I do so, it will be of more price,
JULIET	Being spoke behind your back, than to your face.
JULIET	The tears have got small victory by that;
JULIET	For it was bad enough before their spite.
JULIET	That is no slander, sir, which is a truth;
JULIET	And what I spake, I spake it to my face.
JULIET	It may be so, for it is not mine own.
JULIET	Are you at leisure, holy father, now;
JULIET	Or shall I come to you at evening mass?
JULIET	O! shut the door! and when thou hast done so,
JULIET	Come weep with me; past hope, past cure, past help!
JULIET	Tell me not, friar, that thou hear'st of this,
JULIET	Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it:
JULIET	If, in thy wisdom, thou canst give no help,
JULIET	Do thou but call my resolution wise,
JULIET	And with this knife I'll help it presently,
JULIET	God join'd my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands;
JULIET	And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo seal'd,
JULIET	Shall be the label to another deed,
JULIET	Or my true heart with treacherous revolt
JULIET	Turn to another, this shall slay them both.
JULIET	Therefore, out of thy long-experienc'd time,
JULIET	Give me some present counsel; or behold,
JULIET	'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife
JULIET	Shall play the umpire, arbitrating that
JULIET	Which the commission of thy years and art
JULIET	Could to no issue of true honour bring.
JULIET	Be not so long to speak; I long to die,
JULIET	If what thou speak'st speak not of remedy.
JULIET	O! bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,
JULIET	From off the battlements of yonder tower;
JULIET	Or walk in thievish ways; or bid me lurk
JULIET	Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears;
JULIET	Or shut me nightly in a charnel-house,
JULIET	O'er-cover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones,
JULIET	With reeky shanks, and yellow chapless skulls;
JULIET	Or bid me go into a new-made grave
JULIET	And hide me with a dead man in his shroud;
JULIET	Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble;
JULIET	And I will do it without fear or doubt,
JULIET	To live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love.
JULIET	Give me, give me! O! tell me not of fear!
JULIET	Love, give me strength! and strength shall help afford.
JULIET	Farewell, dear father!
JULIET	Where I have learn'd me to repent the sin
JULIET	Of disobedient opposition
JULIET	To you and your behests; and am enjoin'd
JULIET	By holy Laurence to fall prostrate here,
JULIET	And beg your pardon. Pardon, I beseech you!
JULIET	Henceforward I am ever rul'd by you.
JULIET	I met the youthful lord at Laurence' cell;
JULIET	And gave him what becomed love I might,
JULIET	Not stepping o'er the bounds of modesty.
JULIET	Nurse, will you go with me into my closet,
JULIET	To help me sort such needful ornaments
JULIET	As you think fit to furnish me to-morrow?
JULIET	Ay, those attires are best; but, gentle nurse,
JULIET	I pray thee, leave me to myself to-night;
JULIET	For I have need of many orisons
JULIET	To move the heavens to smile upon my state,
JULIET	Which, well thou know'st, is cross and full of sin.
JULIET	No, madam; we have cull'd such necessaries
JULIET	As are behoveful for our state to-morrow:
JULIET	So please you, let me now be left alone,
JULIET	And let the nurse this night sit up with you;
JULIET	For, I am sure, you have your hands full all
JULIET	In this so sudden business.
JULIET	Farewell! God knows when we shall meet again.
JULIET	I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins,
JULIET	That almost freezes up the heat of life:
JULIET	I'll call them back again to comfort me:
JULIET	Nurse! What should she do here?
JULIET	My dismal scene I needs must act alone.
JULIET	Come, vial.
JULIET	What if this mixture do not work at all?
JULIET	Shall I be married then to-morrow morning?
JULIET	No, no; this shall forbid it: lie thou there.
JULIET	What if it be a poison, which the friar
JULIET	Subtly hath minister'd to have me dead,
JULIET	Lest in this marriage he should be dishonour'd
JULIET	Because he married me before to Romeo?
JULIET	I fear it is: and yet, methinks, it should not,
JULIET	For he hath still been tried a holy man.
JULIET	I will not entertain so bad a thought.
JULIET	How if, when I am laid into the tomb,
JULIET	I wake before the time that Romeo
JULIET	Come to redeem me? there's a fearful point!
JULIET	Shall I not then be stifled in the vault,
JULIET	To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,
JULIET	And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?
JULIET	Or, if I live, is it not very like,
JULIET	The horrible conceit of death and night,
JULIET	Together with the terror of the place,
JULIET	As in a vault, an ancient receptacle,
JULIET	Where, for these many hundred years, the bones
JULIET	Of all my buried ancestors are pack'd;
JULIET	Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,
JULIET	Lies festering in his shroud; where, as they say,
JULIET	At some hours in the night spirits resort:
JULIET	Alack, alack! is it not like that I,
JULIET	So early waking, what with loathsome smells,
JULIET	And shrieks like mandrakes' torn out of the earth,
JULIET	That living mortals, hearing them, run mad:
JULIET	O! if I wake, shall I not be distraught,
JULIET	Environed with all these hideous fears,
JULIET	And madly play with my forefathers' joints,
JULIET	And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud?
JULIET	And, in this rage, with some great kinsman's bone,
JULIET	As with a club, dash out my desperate brains?
JULIET	O, look! methinks I see my cousin's ghost
JULIET	Seeking out Romeo, that did spit his body
JULIET	Upon a rapier's point. Stay, Tybalt, stay!
JULIET	Romeo, I come! this do I drink to thee.
JULIET	O, comfortable friar! where is my lord?
JULIET	I do remember well where I should be,
JULIET	And there I am. Where is my Romeo?
JULIET	Go, get thee hence, for I will not away.
JULIET	What's here? a cup, clos'd in my true love's hand?
JULIET	Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end.
JULIET	O churl! drunk all, and left no friendly drop
JULIET	To help me after! I will kiss thy lips;
JULIET	Haply, some poison yet doth hang on them,
JULIET	To make me die with a restorative.
JULIET	Thy lips are warm!
JULIET	Yea, noise? then I'll be brief. O happy dagger!
JULIET	This is thy sheath;
JULIET	there rest, and let me die.
KING	Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death
KING	The memory be green, and that it us befitted
KING	To bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom
KING	To be contracted in one brow of woe,
KING	Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
KING	That we with wisest sorrow think on him,
KING	Together with remembrance of ourselves.
KING	Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,
KING	The imperial jointress of this war-like state,
KING	Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,
KING	With one auspicious and one dropping eye,
KING	With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage,
KING	In equal scale weighing delight and dole,
KING	Taken to wife: nor have we herein barr'd
KING	Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone
KING	With this affair along: for all, our thanks.
KING	Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,
KING	Holding a weak supposal of our worth,
KING	Or thinking by our late dear brother's death
KING	Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,
KING	Colleagued with the dream of his advantage,
KING	He hath not fail'd to pester us with message,
KING	Importing the surrender of those lands
KING	Lost by his father, with all bands of law,
KING	To our most valiant brother. So much for him.
KING	Now for ourself and for this time of meeting.
KING	Thus much the business is: we have here writ
KING	To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,
KING	Who, impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hears
KING	Of this his nephew's purpose, to suppress
KING	His further gait herein; in that the levies,
KING	The lists and full proportions, are all made
KING	Out of his subject; and we here dispatch
KING	You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltimand,
KING	For bearers of this greeting to old Norway,
KING	Giving to you no further personal power
KING	To business with the king more than the scope
KING	Of these delated articles allow.
KING	Farewell and let your haste commend your duty.
KING	We doubt it nothing: heartily farewell.
KING	And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?
KING	You told us of some suit; what is't, Laertes?
KING	You cannot speak of reason to the Dane,
KING	And lose your voice; what wouldst thou beg, Laertes,
KING	That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?
KING	The head is not more native to the heart,
KING	The hand more instrumental to the mouth,
KING	Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.
KING	What wouldst thou have, Laertes?
KING	Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius?
KING	Take thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine,
KING	And thy best graces spend it at thy will.
KING	But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son,—
KING	How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
KING	'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,
KING	To give these mourning duties to your father:
KING	But, you must know, your father lost a father;
KING	That father lost, lost his; and the survivor bound
KING	In filial obligation for some term
KING	To do obsequious sorrow; but to persever
KING	In obstinate condolement is a course
KING	Of impious stubbornness; 'tis unmanly grief:
KING	It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,
KING	A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,
KING	An understanding simple and unschool'd:
KING	For what we know must be and is as common
KING	As any the most vulgar thing to sense,
KING	Why should we in our peevish opposition
KING	Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,
KING	A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
KING	To reason most absurd, whose common theme
KING	Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,
KING	From the first corse till he that died to-day,
KING	'This must be so.' We pray you, throw to earth
KING	This unprevailing woe, and think of us
KING	As of a father; for let the world take note,
KING	You are the most immediate to our throne;
KING	And with no less nobility of love
KING	Than that which dearest father bears his son
KING	Do I impart toward you. For your intent
KING	In going back to school in Wittenberg,
KING	It is most retrograde to our desire;
KING	And we beseech you, bend you to remain
KING	Here, in the cheer and comfort of our eye,
KING	Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.
KING	Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply:
KING	Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come;
KING	This gentle and unforc'd accord of Hamlet
KING	Sits smiling to my heart; in grace whereof,
KING	No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day,
KING	But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,
KING	And the king's rouse the heavens shall bruit again,
KING	Re-speaking earthly thunder. Come away.
KING	Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern!
KING	Moreover that we much did long to see you,
KING	The need we have to use you did provoke
KING	Our hasty sending. Something have you heard
KING	Of Hamlet's transformation; so I call it,
KING	Since nor the exterior nor the inward man
KING	Resembles that it was. What it should be
KING	More than his father's death, that thus hath put him
KING	So much from the understanding of himself,
KING	I cannot dream of: I entreat you both,
KING	That, being of so young days brought up with him,
KING	And since so neighbour'd to his youth and humour,
KING	That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court
KING	Some little time; so by your companies
KING	To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather,
KING	So much as from occasion you may glean,
KING	Whe'r aught to us unknown afflicts him thus,
KING	That, open'd, lies within our remedy.
KING	Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.
KING	Thou still hast been the father of good news.
KING	O! speak of that; that do I long to hear.
KING	Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in.
KING	He tells me, my sweet queen, that he hath found
KING	The head and source of all your son's distemper.
KING	Well, we shall sift him.
KING	Welcome, my good friends!
KING	Say, Voltimand, what from our brother Norway?
KING	It likes us well;
KING	And at our more consider'd time we'll read,
KING	Answer, and think upon this business:
KING	Meantime we thank you for your well-took labour.
KING	Go to your rest; at night we'll feast together:
KING	Most welcome home.
KING	But how hath she
KING	Receiv'd his love?
KING	As of a man faithful and honourable.
KING	Do you think 'tis this?
KING	Not that I know.
KING	How may we try it further?
KING	We will try it.
KING	And can you, by no drift of circumstance,
KING	Get from him why he puts on this confusion,
KING	Grating so harshly all his days of quiet
KING	With turbulent and dangerous lunacy?
KING	With all my heart; and it doth much content me
KING	To hear him so inclin'd.
KING	Good gentlemen, give him a further edge,
KING	And drive his purpose on to these delights.
KING	Sweet Gertrude, leave us too;
KING	For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither,
KING	That he, as 'twere by accident, may here
KING	Affront Ophelia.
KING	Her father and myself, lawful espials,
KING	Will so bestow ourselves, that, seeing, unseen,
KING	We may of their encounter frankly judge,
KING	And gather by him, as he is behav'd,
KING	If 't be the affliction of his love or no
KING	That thus he suffers for.
KING	O! 'tis too true;
KING	How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience!
KING	The harlot's cheek, beautied with plastering art,
KING	Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it
KING	Than is my deed to my most painted word:
KING	O heavy burden!
KING	Love! his affections do not that way tend;
KING	Nor what he spake, though it lack'd form a little,
KING	Was not like madness. There's something in his soul
KING	O'er which his melancholy sits on brood;
KING	And, I do doubt, the hatch and the disclose
KING	Will be some danger; which for to prevent,
KING	I have in quick determination
KING	Thus set it down: he shall with speed to England,
KING	For the demand of our neglected tribute:
KING	Haply the seas and countries different
KING	With variable objects shall expel
KING	This something-settled matter in his heart,
KING	Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus
KING	From fashion of himself. What think you on't?
KING	It shall be so:
KING	Madness in great ones must not unwatch'd go.
KING	How fares our cousin Hamlet?
KING	I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet; these words are not mine.
KING	Have you heard the argument? Is there no offence in 't?
KING	What do you call the play?
KING	Give me some light: away!
KING	I like him not, nor stands it safe with us
KING	To let his madness range. Therefore prepare you;
KING	I your commission will forth with dispatch,
KING	And he to England shall along with you.
KING	The terms of our estate may not endure
KING	Hazard so dangerous as doth hourly grow
KING	Out of his lunacies.
KING	Arm you, I pray you, to this speedy voyage;
KING	For we will fetters put upon this fear,
KING	Which now goes too free-footed.
KING	Thanks, dear my lord.
KING	O! my offence is rank, it smells to heaven;
KING	It hath the primal eldest curse upon't;
KING	A brother's murder! Pray can I not,
KING	Though inclination be as sharp as will:
KING	My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent;
KING	And, like a man to double business bound,
KING	I stand in pause where I shall first begin,
KING	And both neglect. What if this cursed hand
KING	Were thicker than itself with brother's blood,
KING	Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens
KING	To wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy
KING	But to confront the visage of offence?
KING	And what's in prayer but this two-fold force,
KING	To be forestalled, ere we come to fall,
KING	Or pardon'd, being down? Then, I'll look up;
KING	My fault is past. But, O! what form of prayer
KING	Can serve my turn? 'Forgive me my foul murder?'
KING	That cannot be; since I am still possess'd
KING	Of those effects for which I did the murder,
KING	My crown, mine own ambition, and my queen.
KING	May one be pardon'd and retain the offence?
KING	In the corrupted currents of this world
KING	Offence's gilded hand may shove by justice,
KING	And oft 'tis seen the wicked prise itself
KING	Buys out the law; but 'tis not so above;
KING	There is no shuffling, there the action lies
KING	In his true nature, and we ourselves compell'd
KING	Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults
KING	To give in evidence. What then? what rests?
KING	Try what repentance can: what can it not?
KING	Yet what can it, when one can not repent?
KING	O wretched state! O bosom black as death!
KING	O limed soul, that struggling to be free
KING	Art more engaged! Help, angels! make assay;
KING	Bow, stubborn knees; and heart with strings of steel
KING	Be soft as sinews of the new-born babe.
KING	All may be well.
KING	My words fly up, my thoughts remain below:
KING	Words without thoughts never to heaven go.
KING	There's matter in these sighs, these profound heaves:
KING	You must translate; 'tis fit we understand them.
KING	Where is your son?
KING	What, Gertrude? How does Hamlet?
KING	O heavy deed!
KING	It had been so with us had we been there.
KING	His liberty is full of threats to all;
KING	To you yourself, to us, to every one.
KING	Alas! how shall this bloody deed be answer'd?
KING	It will be laid to us, whose providence
KING	Should have kept short, restrain'd, and out of haunt,
KING	This mad young man: but so much was our love,
KING	We would not understand what was most fit,
KING	But, like the owner of a foul disease,
KING	To keep it from divulging, let it feed
KING	Even on the pith of life. Where is he gone?
KING	O Gertrude! come away.
KING	The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch
KING	But we will ship him hence; and this vile deed
KING	We must, with all our majesty and skill,
KING	Both countenance and excuse. Ho! Guildenstern!
KING	Friends both, go join you with some further aid:
KING	Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain,
KING	And from his mother's closet hath he dragg'd him:
KING	Go seek him out; speak fair, and bring the body
KING	Into the chapel. I pray you, haste in this.
KING	Come, Gertrude, we'll call up our wisest friends;
KING	And let them know both what we mean to do,
KING	And what's untimely done: so, haply, slander,
KING	Whose whisper o'er the world's diameter,
KING	As level as the cannon to his blank
KING	Transports his poison'd shot, may miss our name,
KING	And hit the woundless air. O! come away;
KING	My soul is full of discord and dismay.
KING	I have sent to seek him, and to find the body.
KING	How dangerous is it that this man goes loose!
KING	Yet must not we put the strong law on him:
KING	He's lov'd of the distracted multitude,
KING	Who like not in their judgment, but their eyes;
KING	And where 'tis so, the offender's scourge is weigh'd,
KING	But never the offence. To bear all smooth and even,
KING	This sudden sending him away must seem
KING	Deliberate pause: diseases desperate grown
KING	By desperate appliance are reliev'd,
KING	Or not at all.
KING	How now! what hath befall'n?
KING	But where is he?
KING	Bring him before us.
KING	Now, Hamlet, where's Polonius?
KING	At supper! Where?
KING	Alas, alas!
KING	What dost thou mean by this?
KING	Where is Polonius?
KING	Go seek him there.
KING	Hamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety,
KING	Which we do tender, as we dearly grieve
KING	For that which thou hast done, must send thee hence
KING	With fiery quickness: therefore prepare thyself;
KING	The bark is ready, and the wind at help,
KING	The associates tend, and every thing is bent
KING	For England.
KING	Ay, Hamlet.
KING	So is it, if thou knew'st our purposes.
KING	Thy loving father, Hamlet.
KING	Follow him at foot; tempt him with speed aboard:
KING	Delay it not, I'll have him hence to-night.
KING	Away! for every thing is seal'd and done
KING	That else leans on the affair: pray you, make haste.
KING	And, England, if my love thou hold'st at aught,—
KING	As my great power thereof may give thee sense,
KING	Since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red
KING	After the Danish sword, and thy free awe
KING	Pays homage to us,—thou mayst not coldly set
KING	Our sovereign process, which imports at full,
KING	By letters conjuring to that effect,
KING	The present death of Hamlet. Do it, England;
KING	For like the hectic in my blood he rages,
KING	And thou must cure me. Till I know 'tis done,
KING	Howe'er my haps, my joys were ne'er begun.
KING	How do you, pretty lady?
KING	Conceit upon her father.
KING	Pretty Ophelia!
KING	How long hath she been thus?
KING	Follow her close; give her good watch, I pray you.
KING	O! this is the poison of deep grief; it springs
KING	All from her father's death. O Gertrude, Gertrude!
KING	When sorrows come, they come not single spies,
KING	But in battalions. First, her father slain;
KING	Next, your son gone; but he most violent author
KING	Of his own just remove: the people muddied,
KING	Thick and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers,
KING	For good Polonius' death; and we have done but greenly,
KING	In hugger-mugger to inter him: poor Ophelia
KING	Divided from herself and her fair judgment,
KING	Without the which we are pictures, or mere beasts:
KING	Last, and as much containing as all these,
KING	Her brother is in secret come from France,
KING	Feeds on his wonder, keeps himself in clouds,
KING	And wants not buzzers to infect his ear
KING	With pestilent speeches of his father's death;
KING	Wherein necessity, of matter beggar'd,
KING	Will nothing stick our person to arraign
KING	In ear and ear. O my dear Gertrude! this,
KING	Like to a murdering-piece, in many places
KING	Gives me superfluous death.
KING	Where are my Switzers? Let them guard the door.
KING	What is the matter?
KING	The doors are broke.
KING	What is the cause, Laertes,
KING	That thy rebellion looks so giant-like?
KING	Let him go, Gertrude; do not fear our person:
KING	There's such divinity doth hedge a king,
KING	That treason can but peep to what it would,
KING	Acts little of his will. Tell me, Laertes,
KING	Why thou art thus incens'd. Let him go, Gertrude.
KING	Speak, man.
KING	Dead.
KING	Let him demand his fill.
KING	Who shall stay you?
KING	Good Laertes,
KING	If you desire to know the certainty
KING	Of your dear father's death, is't writ in your revenge,
KING	That, swoopstake, you will draw both friend and foe,
KING	Winner and loser?
KING	Will you know them then?
KING	Why, now you speak
KING	Like a good child and a true gentleman.
KING	That I am guiltless of your father's death,
KING	And am most sensibly in grief for it,
KING	It shall as level to your judgment pierce
KING	As day does to your eye.
KING	Laertes, I must common with your grief,
KING	Or you deny me right. Go but apart,
KING	Make choice of whom your wisest friends you will,
KING	And they shall hear and judge 'twixt you and me.
KING	If by direct or by collateral hand
KING	They find us touch'd, we will our kingdom give,
KING	Our crown, our life, and all that we call ours,
KING	To you in satisfaction; but if not,
KING	Be you content to lend your patience to us,
KING	And we shall jointly labour with your soul
KING	To give it due content.
KING	So you shall;
KING	And where the offence is let the great axe fall.
KING	I pray you go with me.
KING	Now must your conscience my acquittance seal,
KING	And you must put me in your heart for friend,
KING	Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,
KING	That he which hath your noble father slain
KING	Pursu'd my life.
KING	O! for two special reasons;
KING	Which may to you, perhaps, seem much unsinew'd,
KING	But yet to me they are strong. The queen his mother
KING	Lives almost by his looks, and for myself,—
KING	My virtue or my plague, be it either which,—
KING	She's so conjunctive to my life and soul,
KING	That, as the star moves not but in his sphere,
KING	I could not but by her. The other motive,
KING	Why to a public count I might not go,
KING	Is the great love the general gender bear him;
KING	Who, dipping all his faults in their affection,
KING	Would, like the spring that turneth wood to stone,
KING	Convert his gyves to graces; so that my arrows,
KING	Too slightly timber'd for so loud a wind,
KING	Would have reverted to my bow again,
KING	And not where I had aim'd them.
KING	Break not your sleeps for that; you must not think
KING	That we are made of stuff so flat and dull
KING	That we can let our beard be shook with danger
KING	And think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more;
KING	I lov'd your father, and we love ourself,
KING	And that, I hope, will teach you to imagine,—
KING	How now! what news?
KING	From Hamlet! who brought them?
KING	Laertes, you shall hear them.
KING	Leave us.
KING	High and mighty, you shall know I am set naked on your kingdom. To-morrow shall I beg leave to see your kingly eyes; when I shall, first asking your pardon thereunto, recount the occasions of my sudden and more strange return
KING	What should this mean? Are all the rest come back?
KING	Or is it some abuse and no such thing?
KING	'Tis Hamlet's character. 'Naked,'
KING	And in a postscript here, he says, 'alone.'
KING	Can you advise me?
KING	If it be so, Laertes,
KING	As how should it be so? how otherwise?
KING	Will you be rul'd by me?
KING	To thine own peace. If he be now return'd,
KING	As checking at his voyage, and that he means
KING	No more to undertake it, I will work him
KING	To an exploit, now ripe in my device,
KING	Under the which he shall not choose but fall;
KING	And for his death no wind of blame shall breathe,
KING	But even his mother shall uncharge the practice
KING	And call it accident.
KING	It falls right.
KING	You have been talk'd of since your travel much,
KING	And that in Hamlet's hearing, for a quality
KING	Wherein, they say, you shine; your sum of parts
KING	Did not together pluck such envy from him
KING	As did that one, and that, in my regard,
KING	Of the unworthiest siege.
KING	A very riband in the cap of youth,
KING	Yet needful too; for youth no less becomes
KING	The light and careless livery that it wears
KING	Than settled age his sables and his weeds,
KING	Importing health and graveness. Two months since
KING	Here was a gentleman of Normandy:
KING	I've seen myself, and serv'd against, the French,
KING	And they can well on horseback; but this gallant
KING	Had witchcraft in 't, he grew unto his seat,
KING	And to such wondrous doing brought his horse,
KING	As he had been incorps'd and demi-natur'd
KING	With the brave beast; so far he topp'd my thought,
KING	That I, in forgery of shapes and tricks,
KING	Come short of what he did.
KING	A Norman.
KING	The very same.
KING	He made confession of you,
KING	And gave you such a masterly report
KING	For art and exercise in your defence,
KING	And for your rapier most especially,
KING	That he cried out, 'twould be a sight indeed
KING	If one could match you; the scrimers of their nation,
KING	He swore, had neither motion, guard, nor eye,
KING	If you oppos'd them. Sir, this report of his
KING	Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy
KING	That he could nothing do but wish and beg
KING	Your sudden coming o'er, to play with him.
KING	Now, out of this,—
KING	Laertes, was your father dear to you?
KING	Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,
KING	A face without a heart?
KING	Not that I think you did not love your father,
KING	But that I know love is begun by time,
KING	And that I see, in passages of proof,
KING	Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.
KING	There lives within the very flame of love
KING	A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it,
KING	And nothing is at a like goodness still,
KING	For goodness, growing to a plurisy,
KING	Dies in his own too-much. That we would do,
KING	We should do when we would, for this 'would' changes,
KING	And hath abatements and delays as many
KING	As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;
KING	And then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh,
KING	That hurts by easing. But, to the quick o' the ulcer;
KING	Hamlet comes back; what would you undertake
KING	To show yourself your father's son in deed
KING	More than in words?
KING	No place, indeed, should murder sanctuarize;
KING	Revenge should have no bounds. But, good Laertes,
KING	Will you do this, keep close within your chamber.
KING	Hamlet return'd shall know you are come home;
KING	We'll put on those shall praise your excellence,
KING	And set a double varnish on the fame
KING	The Frenchman gave you, bring you, in fine, together,
KING	And wager on your heads: he, being remise,
KING	Most generous and free from all contriving,
KING	Will not peruse the foils; so that, with ease
KING	Or with a little shuffling, you may choose
KING	A sword unbated, and, in a pass of practice
KING	Requite him for your father.
KING	Let's further think of this;
KING	Weigh what convenience both of time and means
KING	May fit us to our shape. If this should fail,
KING	And that our drift look through our bad performance
KING	'Twere better not assay'd; therefore this project
KING	Should have a back or second, that might hold,
KING	If this should blast in proof. Soft! let me see;
KING	We'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings:
KING	I ha't:
KING	When in your motion you are hot and dry,—
KING	As make your bouts more violent to that end,—
KING	And that he calls for drink, I'll have prepar'd him
KING	A chalice for the nonce, whereon but sipping,
KING	If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,
KING	Our purpose may hold there. But stay! what noise?
KING	How now, sweet queen!
KING	Let's follow, Gertrude.
KING	How much I had to do to calm his rage!
KING	Now fear I this will give it start again;
KING	Therefore let's follow.
KING	Pluck them asunder.
KING	O! he is mad, Laertes.
KING	I pray you, good Horatio, wait upon him.
KING	Strengthen your patience in our last night's speech;
KING	We'll put the matter to the present push.
KING	Good Gertrude, set some watch over your son.
KING	This grave shall have a living monument:
KING	An hour of quiet shortly shall we see;
KING	Till then, in patience our proceeding be.
KING	Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.
KING	Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet,
KING	You know the wager?
KING	I do not fear it; I have seen you both;
KING	But since he is better'd, we have therefore odds.
KING	Set me the stoups of wine upon that table.
KING	If Hamlet give the first or second hit,
KING	Or quit in answer of the third exchange,
KING	Let all the battlements their ordnance fire;
KING	The king shall drink to Hamlet's better breath;
KING	And in the cup an union shall he throw,
KING	Richer than that which four successive kings
KING	In Denmark's crown have worn. Give me the cups;
KING	And let the kettle to the trumpet speak,
KING	The trumpet to the cannoneer without,
KING	The cannons to the heavens, the heavens to earth,
KING	'Now the king drinks to Hamlet!' Come, begin;
KING	And you, the judges, bear a wary eye.
KING	Stay; give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine;
KING	Here's to thy health. Give him the cup.
KING	Our son shall win.
KING	Gertrude, do not drink.
KING	It is the poison'd cup! it is too late.
KING	I do not think 't
KING	Part them! they are incens'd
KING	She swounds to see them bleed.
KING	O! yet defend me, friends; I am but hurt.
LADY MACBETH	Thou'rt mad to say it.
LADY MACBETH	Is not thy master with him? who, were't so,
LADY MACBETH	Would have inform'd for preparation.
LADY MACBETH	Give him tending;
LADY MACBETH	He brings great news.—
LADY MACBETH	The raven himself is hoarse
LADY MACBETH	That croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan
LADY MACBETH	Under my battlements. Come, you spirits
LADY MACBETH	That tend on mortal thoughts! unsex me here,
LADY MACBETH	And fill me from the crown to the toe top full
LADY MACBETH	Of direst cruelty; make thick my blood,
LADY MACBETH	Stop up the access and passage to remorse,
LADY MACBETH	That no compunctious visitings of nature
LADY MACBETH	Shake my fell purpose, nor keep peace between
LADY MACBETH	The effect and it! Come to my woman's breasts,
LADY MACBETH	And take my milk for gall, you murdering ministers,
LADY MACBETH	Wherever in your sightless substances
LADY MACBETH	You wait on nature's mischief! Come, thick night,
LADY MACBETH	And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell,
LADY MACBETH	That my keen knife see not the wound it makes,
LADY MACBETH	Nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark,
LADY MACBETH	To cry, 'Hold, hold!'
LADY MACBETH	Great Glamis! worthy Cawdor!
LADY MACBETH	Greater than both, by the all-hail hereafter!
LADY MACBETH	Thy letters have transported me beyond
LADY MACBETH	This ignorant present, and I feel now
LADY MACBETH	The future in the instant.
LADY MACBETH	And when goes hence?
LADY MACBETH	O! never
LADY MACBETH	Shall sun that morrow see.
LADY MACBETH	Your face, my thane, is as a book where men
LADY MACBETH	May read strange matters. To beguile the time,
LADY MACBETH	Look like the time; bear welcome in your eye,
LADY MACBETH	Your hand, your tongue: look like the innocent flower,
LADY MACBETH	But be the serpent under't. He that's coming
LADY MACBETH	Must be provided for; and you shall put
LADY MACBETH	This night's great business into my dispatch;
LADY MACBETH	Which shall to all our nights and days to come
LADY MACBETH	Give solely sovereign sway and masterdom.
LADY MACBETH	Only look up clear;
LADY MACBETH	To alter favour ever is to fear.
LADY MACBETH	Leave all the rest to me.
LADY MACBETH	All our service,
LADY MACBETH	In every point twice done, and then done double,
LADY MACBETH	Were poor and single business, to contend
LADY MACBETH	Against those honours deep and broad wherewith
LADY MACBETH	Your majesty loads our house: for those of old,
LADY MACBETH	And the late dignities heap'd up to them,
LADY MACBETH	We rest your hermits.
LADY MACBETH	Your servants ever
LADY MACBETH	Have theirs, themselves, and what is theirs, in compt,
LADY MACBETH	To make their audit at your highness' pleasure,
LADY MACBETH	Still to return your own.
LADY MACBETH	He has almost supp'd: why have you left the chamber?
LADY MACBETH	Know you not he has?
LADY MACBETH	Was the hope drunk,
LADY MACBETH	Wherein you dress'd yourself? hath it slept since,
LADY MACBETH	And wakes it now, to look so green and pale
LADY MACBETH	At what it did so freely? From this time
LADY MACBETH	Such I account thy love. Art thou afeard
LADY MACBETH	To be the same in thine own act and valour
LADY MACBETH	As thou art in desire? Wouldst thou have that
LADY MACBETH	Which thou esteem'st the ornament of life,
LADY MACBETH	And live a coward in thine own esteem,
LADY MACBETH	Letting 'I dare not' wait upon 'I would,'
LADY MACBETH	Like the poor cat i' the adage?
LADY MACBETH	What beast was't, then,
LADY MACBETH	That made you break this enterprise to me?
LADY MACBETH	When you durst do it then you were a man;
LADY MACBETH	And, to be more than what you were, you would
LADY MACBETH	Be so much more the man. Nor time nor place
LADY MACBETH	Did then adhere, and yet you would make both:
LADY MACBETH	They have made themselves, and that their fitness now
LADY MACBETH	Does unmake you. I have given suck, and know
LADY MACBETH	How tender 'tis to love the babe that milks me:
LADY MACBETH	I would, while it was smiling in my face,
LADY MACBETH	Have pluck'd my nipple from his boneless gums,
LADY MACBETH	And dash'd the brains out, had I so sworn as you
LADY MACBETH	Have done to this.
LADY MACBETH	We fail!
LADY MACBETH	But screw your courage to the sticking-place,
LADY MACBETH	And we'll not fail. When Duncan is asleep,
LADY MACBETH	Whereto the rather shall his day's hard journey
LADY MACBETH	Soundly invite him, his two chamberlains
LADY MACBETH	Will I with wine and wassail so convince
LADY MACBETH	That memory, the warder of the brain,
LADY MACBETH	Shall be a fume, and the receipt of reason
LADY MACBETH	A limbeck only; when in swinish sleep
LADY MACBETH	Their drenched natures lie, as in a death,
LADY MACBETH	What cannot you and I perform upon
LADY MACBETH	The unguarded Duncan? what not put upon
LADY MACBETH	His spongy officers, who shall bear the guilt
LADY MACBETH	Of our great quell?
LADY MACBETH	Who dares receive it other,
LADY MACBETH	As we shall make our griefs and clamour roar
LADY MACBETH	Upon his death?
LADY MACBETH	That which hath made them drunk hath made me bold,
LADY MACBETH	What hath quench'd them hath given me fire. Hark!
LADY MACBETH	Peace!
LADY MACBETH	It was the owl that shriek'd, the fatal bellman,
LADY MACBETH	Which gives the stern'st good-night. He is about it:
LADY MACBETH	The doors are open, and the surfeited grooms
LADY MACBETH	Do mock their charge with snores: I have drugg'd their possets,
LADY MACBETH	That death and nature do contend about them,
LADY MACBETH	Whether they live or die.
LADY MACBETH	Alack! I am afraid they have awak'd,
LADY MACBETH	And 'tis not done; the attempt and not the deed
LADY MACBETH	Confounds us. Hark! I laid their daggers ready;
LADY MACBETH	He could not miss them. Had he not resembled
LADY MACBETH	My father as he slept I had done 't. My husband!
LADY MACBETH	I heard the owl scream and the crickets cry.
LADY MACBETH	Did not you speak?
LADY MACBETH	Now.
LADY MACBETH	Ay.
LADY MACBETH	Donalbain.
LADY MACBETH	A foolish thought to say a sorry sight.
LADY MACBETH	There are two lodg'd together.
LADY MACBETH	Consider it not so deeply.
LADY MACBETH	These deeds must not be thought
LADY MACBETH	After these ways; so, it will make us mad.
LADY MACBETH	What do you mean?
LADY MACBETH	Who was it that thus cried? Why, worthy thane,
LADY MACBETH	You do unbend your noble strength to think
LADY MACBETH	So brainsickly of things. Go get some water,
LADY MACBETH	And wash this filthy witness from your hand.
LADY MACBETH	Why did you bring these daggers from the place?
LADY MACBETH	They must lie there: go carry them, and smear
LADY MACBETH	The sleepy grooms with blood.
LADY MACBETH	Infirm of purpose!
LADY MACBETH	Give me the daggers. The sleeping and the dead
LADY MACBETH	Are but as pictures; 'tis the eye of childhood
LADY MACBETH	That fears a painted devil. If he do bleed,
LADY MACBETH	I'll gild the faces of the grooms withal;
LADY MACBETH	For it must seem their guilt.
LADY MACBETH	My hands are of your colour, but I shame
LADY MACBETH	To wear a heart so white.—
LADY MACBETH	I hear a knocking
LADY MACBETH	At the south entry; retire we to our chamber;
LADY MACBETH	A little water clears us of this deed;
LADY MACBETH	How easy is it, then! Your constancy
LADY MACBETH	Hath left you unattended.
LADY MACBETH	Hark! more knocking.
LADY MACBETH	Get on your night-gown, lest occasion call us,
LADY MACBETH	And show us to be watchers. Be not lost
LADY MACBETH	So poorly in your thoughts.
LADY MACBETH	What's the business,
LADY MACBETH	That such a hideous trumpet calls to parley
LADY MACBETH	The sleepers of the house? speak, speak!
LADY MACBETH	Woe, alas!
LADY MACBETH	What! in our house?
LADY MACBETH	Help me hence, ho!
LADY MACBETH	If he had been forgotten
LADY MACBETH	It had been as a gap in our great feast,
LADY MACBETH	And all-thing unbecoming.
LADY MACBETH	Is Banquo gone from court?
LADY MACBETH	Say to the king, I would attend his leisure
LADY MACBETH	For a few words.
LADY MACBETH	Nought's had, all's spent,
LADY MACBETH	Where our desire is got without content:
LADY MACBETH	'Tis safer to be that which we destroy
LADY MACBETH	Than by destruction dwell in doubtful joy.
LADY MACBETH	How now, my lord! why do you keep alone,
LADY MACBETH	Of sorriest fancies your companions making,
LADY MACBETH	Using those thoughts which should indeed have died
LADY MACBETH	With them they think on? Things without all remedy
LADY MACBETH	Should be without regard: what's done is done.
LADY MACBETH	Come on;
LADY MACBETH	Gentle my lord, sleek o'er your rugged looks;
LADY MACBETH	Be bright and jovial among your guests to-night.
LADY MACBETH	You must leave this.
LADY MACBETH	But in them nature's copy's not eterne.
LADY MACBETH	What's to be done?
LADY MACBETH	Pronounce it for me, sir, to all our friends;
LADY MACBETH	For my heart speaks they are welcome.
LADY MACBETH	My royal lord,
LADY MACBETH	You do not give the cheer: the feast is sold
LADY MACBETH	That is not often vouch'd, while 'tis a-making,
LADY MACBETH	'Tis given with welcome: to feed were best at home;
LADY MACBETH	From thence, the sauce to meat is ceremony;
LADY MACBETH	Meeting were bare without it.
LADY MACBETH	Sit, worthy friends: my lord is often thus,
LADY MACBETH	And hath been from his youth: pray you, keep seat;
LADY MACBETH	The fit is momentary; upon a thought
LADY MACBETH	He will again be well. If much you note him
LADY MACBETH	You shall offend him and extend his passion:
LADY MACBETH	Feed and regard him not. Are you a man?
LADY MACBETH	O proper stuff!
LADY MACBETH	This is the very painting of your fear;
LADY MACBETH	This is the air-drawn dagger which, you said,
LADY MACBETH	Led you to Duncan. O! these flaws and starts—
LADY MACBETH	Impostors to true fear—would well become
LADY MACBETH	A woman's story at a winter's fire,
LADY MACBETH	Authoriz'd by her grandam. Shame itself!
LADY MACBETH	Why do you make such faces? When all's done
LADY MACBETH	You look but on a stool.
LADY MACBETH	What! quite unmann'd in folly?
LADY MACBETH	Fie, for shame!
LADY MACBETH	My worthy lord,
LADY MACBETH	Your noble friends do lack you.
LADY MACBETH	Think of this, good peers,
LADY MACBETH	But as a thing of custom: 'tis no other;
LADY MACBETH	Only it spoils the pleasure of the time.
LADY MACBETH	You have displac'd the mirth, broke the good meeting,
LADY MACBETH	With most admir'd disorder.
LADY MACBETH	I pray you, speak not; he grows worse and worse;
LADY MACBETH	Question enrages him. At once, good-night:
LADY MACBETH	Stand not upon the order of your going,
LADY MACBETH	But go at once.
LADY MACBETH	A kind good-night to all!
LADY MACBETH	Almost at odds with morning, which is which.
LADY MACBETH	Did you send to him, sir?
LADY MACBETH	You lack the season of all natures, sleep.
LADY MACBETH	What had he done to make him fly the land?
LADY MACBETH	He had none:
LADY MACBETH	His flight was madness: when our actions do not,
LADY MACBETH	Our fears do make us traitors.
LADY MACBETH	Wisdom! to leave his wife, to leave his babes,
LADY MACBETH	His mansion and his titles in a place
LADY MACBETH	From whence himself does fly? He loves us not;
LADY MACBETH	He wants the natural touch; for the poor wren,
LADY MACBETH	The most diminutive of birds, will fight—
LADY MACBETH	Her young ones in her nest—against the owl.
LADY MACBETH	All is the fear and nothing is the love;
LADY MACBETH	As little is the wisdom, where the flight
LADY MACBETH	So runs against all reason.
LADY MACBETH	Father'd he is, and yet he's fatherless.
LADY MACBETH	Sirrah, your father's dead:
LADY MACBETH	And what will you do now? How will you live?
LADY MACBETH	What! with worms and flies?
LADY MACBETH	Poor bird! thou'dst never fear the net nor lime,
LADY MACBETH	The pit-fall nor the gin.
LADY MACBETH	Yes, he is dead: how wilt thou do for a father?
LADY MACBETH	Why, I can buy me twenty at any market.
LADY MACBETH	Thou speak'st with all thy wit; and yet, i' faith,
LADY MACBETH	With wit enough for thee.
LADY MACBETH	Ay, that he was.
LADY MACBETH	Why, one that swears and lies.
LADY MACBETH	Every one that does so is a traitor, and must be hanged.
LADY MACBETH	Every one.
LADY MACBETH	Why, the honest men.
LADY MACBETH	Now God help thee, poor monkey!
LADY MACBETH	But how wilt thou do for a father?
LADY MACBETH	Poor prattler, how thou talk'st!
LADY MACBETH	Whither should I fly?
LADY MACBETH	I have done no harm. But I remember now
LADY MACBETH	I am in this earthly world, where, to do harm
LADY MACBETH	Is often laudable, to do good sometime
LADY MACBETH	Accounted dangerous folly; why then, alas!
LADY MACBETH	Do I put up that womanly defence,
LADY MACBETH	To say I have done no harm?
LADY MACBETH	What are these faces?
LADY MACBETH	I hope in no place so unsanctified
LADY MACBETH	Where such as thou mayst find him.
LADY MACBETH	Yet here's a spot.
LADY MACBETH	Out, damned spot! out, I say! One; two: why, then, 'tis time to do't. Hell is murky! Fie, my lord, fie! a soldier, and afeard? What need we fear who knows it, when none can call our power to account? Yet who would have thought the old man to have had so much blood in him?
LADY MACBETH	The Thane of Fife had a wife: where is she now? What! will these hands ne'er be clean? No more o' that, my lord, no more o' that: you mar all with this starting.
LADY MACBETH	Here's the smell of the blood still: all the perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little hand. Oh! oh! oh!
LADY MACBETH	Wash your hands, put on your night-gown; look not so pale. I tell you yet again, Banquo's buried; he cannot come out on 's grave.
LADY MACBETH	To bed, to bed: there's knocking at the gate. Come, come, come, come, give me your hand. What's done cannot be undone.
LADY MACBETH	To bed, to bed, to bed.
LAERTES	Dread my lord,
LAERTES	Your leave and favour to return to France;
LAERTES	From whence though willingly I came to Denmark,
LAERTES	To show my duty in your coronation,
LAERTES	Yet now, I must confess, that duty done,
LAERTES	My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France
LAERTES	And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.
LAERTES	My necessaries are embark'd; farewell:
LAERTES	And, sister, as the winds give benefit
LAERTES	And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,
LAERTES	But let me hear from you.
LAERTES	For Hamlet, and the trifling of his favour,
LAERTES	Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood,
LAERTES	A violet in the youth of primy nature,
LAERTES	Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting,
LAERTES	The perfume and suppliance of a minute;
LAERTES	No more.
LAERTES	Think it no more:
LAERTES	For nature, crescent, does not grow alone
LAERTES	In thews and bulk; but, as this temple waxes,
LAERTES	The inward service of the mind and soul
LAERTES	Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,
LAERTES	And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
LAERTES	The virtue of his will; but you must fear,
LAERTES	His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own,
LAERTES	For he himself is subject to his birth;
LAERTES	He may not, as unvalu'd persons do,
LAERTES	Carve for himself, for on his choice depends
LAERTES	The safety and the health of the whole state;
LAERTES	And therefore must his choice be circumscrib'd
LAERTES	Unto the voice and yielding of that body
LAERTES	Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,
LAERTES	It fits your wisdom so far to believe it
LAERTES	As he in his particular act and place
LAERTES	May give his saying deed; which is no further
LAERTES	Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.
LAERTES	Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain,
LAERTES	If with too credent ear you list his songs,
LAERTES	Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open
LAERTES	To his unmaster'd importunity.
LAERTES	Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister;
LAERTES	And keep you in the rear of your affection,
LAERTES	Out of the shot and danger of desire.
LAERTES	The chariest maid is prodigal enough
LAERTES	If she unmask her beauty to the moon;
LAERTES	Virtue herself 'scapes not calumnious strokes;
LAERTES	The canker galls the infants of the spring
LAERTES	Too oft before their buttons be disclos'd,
LAERTES	And in the morn and liquid dew of youth
LAERTES	Contagious blastments are most imminent.
LAERTES	Be wary then; best safety lies in fear:
LAERTES	Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.
LAERTES	O! fear me not.
LAERTES	I stay too long; but here my father comes.
LAERTES	A double blessing is a double grace;
LAERTES	Occasion smiles upon a second leave.
LAERTES	Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.
LAERTES	Farewell, Ophelia; and remember well
LAERTES	What I have said to you.
LAERTES	Farewell.
LAERTES	Where is the king? Sirs, stand you all without.
LAERTES	I pray you, give me leave.
LAERTES	I thank you: keep the door. O thou vile king!
LAERTES	Give me my father.
LAERTES	That drop of blood that's calm proclaims me bastard,
LAERTES	Cries cuckold to my father, brands the harlot
LAERTES	Even here, between the chaste unsmirched brow
LAERTES	Of my true mother.
LAERTES	Where is my father?
LAERTES	How came he dead? I'll not be juggled with.
LAERTES	To hell, allegiance! vows, to the blackest devil!
LAERTES	Conscience and grace, to the profoundest pit!
LAERTES	I dare damnation. To this point I stand,
LAERTES	That both the worlds I give to negligence,
LAERTES	Let come what comes; only I'll be reveng'd
LAERTES	Most throughly for my father.
LAERTES	My will, not all the world:
LAERTES	And, for my means, I'll husband them so well,
LAERTES	They shall go far with little.
LAERTES	None but his enemies.
LAERTES	To his good friends thus wide I'll ope my arms;
LAERTES	And like the kind life-rendering pelican,
LAERTES	Repast them with my blood.
LAERTES	How now! what noise is that?
LAERTES	O heat, dry up my brains! tears seven times salt,
LAERTES	Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye;
LAERTES	By heaven, thy madness shall be paid by weight,
LAERTES	Till our scale turn the beam. O rose of May!
LAERTES	Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia!
LAERTES	O heavens! is't possible a young maid's wits
LAERTES	Should be as mortal as an old man's life?
LAERTES	Nature is fine in love, and where 'tis fine
LAERTES	It sends some precious instance of itself
LAERTES	After the thing it loves.
LAERTES	Hadst thou thy wits, and didst persuade revenge,
LAERTES	It could not move thus.
LAERTES	This nothing's more than matter.
LAERTES	A document in madness, thoughts and remembrance fitted.
LAERTES	Thought and affliction, passion, hell itself,
LAERTES	She turns to favour and to prettiness.
LAERTES	Do you see this, O God?
LAERTES	Let this be so:
LAERTES	His means of death, his obscure burial,
LAERTES	No trophy, sword, nor hatchment o'er his bones,
LAERTES	No noble rite nor formal ostentation,
LAERTES	Cry to be heard, as 'twere from heaven to earth,
LAERTES	That I must call 't in question.
LAERTES	It well appears: but tell me
LAERTES	Why you proceeded not against these feats,
LAERTES	So crimeful and so capital in nature,
LAERTES	As by your safety, wisdom, all things else,
LAERTES	You mainly were stirr'd up.
LAERTES	And so have I a noble father lost;
LAERTES	A sister driven into desperate terms,
LAERTES	Whose worth, if praises may go back again,
LAERTES	Stood challenger on mount of all the age
LAERTES	For her perfections. But my revenge will come.
LAERTES	Know you the hand?
LAERTES	I'm lost in it, my lord. But let him come:
LAERTES	It warms the very sickness in my heart,
LAERTES	That I shall live and tell him to his teeth,
LAERTES	'Thus diddest thou.'
LAERTES	Ay, my lord;
LAERTES	So you will not o'er-rule me to a peace.
LAERTES	My lord, I will be rul'd;
LAERTES	The rather, if you could devise it so
LAERTES	That I might be the organ.
LAERTES	What part is that, my lord?
LAERTES	A Norman was 't?
LAERTES	Upon my life, Lamord.
LAERTES	I know him well; he is the brooch indeed
LAERTES	And gem of all the nation.
LAERTES	What out of this, my lord?
LAERTES	Why ask you this?
LAERTES	To cut his throat i' the church.
LAERTES	I will do 't;
LAERTES	And, for that purpose, I'll anoint my sword.
LAERTES	I bought an unction of a mountebank,
LAERTES	So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,
LAERTES	Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,
LAERTES	Collected from all simples that have virtue
LAERTES	Under the moon, can save the thing from death
LAERTES	That is but scratch'd withal; I'll touch my point
LAERTES	With this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly,
LAERTES	It may be death.
LAERTES	Drown'd! O, where?
LAERTES	Alas! then, she is drown'd?
LAERTES	Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelis,
LAERTES	And therefore I forbid my tears; but yet
LAERTES	It is our trick, nature her custom holds,
LAERTES	Let shame say what it will; when these are gone
LAERTES	The woman will be out. Adieu, my lord!
LAERTES	I have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze,
LAERTES	But that this folly douts it.
LAERTES	What ceremony else?
LAERTES	What ceremony else?
LAERTES	Must there no more be done?
LAERTES	Lay her i' the earth;
LAERTES	And from her fair and unpolluted flesh
LAERTES	May violets spring! I tell thee, churlish priest,
LAERTES	A ministering angel shall my sister be,
LAERTES	When thou liest howling.
LAERTES	O! treble woe
LAERTES	Fall ten times treble on that cursed head
LAERTES	Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense
LAERTES	Depriv'd thee of. Hold off the earth awhile,
LAERTES	Till I have caught her once more in mine arms.
LAERTES	Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead,
LAERTES	Till of this flat a mountain you have made,
LAERTES	To o'er-top old Pelion or the skyish head
LAERTES	Of blue Olympus.
LAERTES	The devil take thy soul!
LAERTES	I am satisfied in nature,
LAERTES	Whose motive, in this case, should stir me most
LAERTES	To my revenge; but in my terms of honour
LAERTES	I stand aloof, and will no reconcilement,
LAERTES	Till by some elder masters, of known honour,
LAERTES	I have a voice and precedent of peace,
LAERTES	To keep my name ungor'd. But till that time,
LAERTES	I do receive your offer'd love like love,
LAERTES	And will not wrong it.
LAERTES	Come, one for me.
LAERTES	You mock me, sir.
LAERTES	This is too heavy; let me see another.
LAERTES	Come, my lord.
LAERTES	No.
LAERTES	Well; again.
LAERTES	A touch, a touch, I do confess.
LAERTES	My lord, I'll hit him now.
LAERTES	And yet 'tis almost 'gainst my conscience.
LAERTES	Say you so? come on.
LAERTES	Have at you now.
LAERTES	Why, as a woodcock to mine own springe, Osric;
LAERTES	I am justly kill'd with mine own treachery.
LAERTES	It is here, Hamlet. Hamlet, thou art slain;
LAERTES	No medicine in the world can do thee good;
LAERTES	In thee there is not half an hour of life;
LAERTES	The treacherous instrument is in thy hand,
LAERTES	Unbated and envenom'd. The foul practice
LAERTES	Hath turn'd itself on me; lo! here I lie,
LAERTES	Never to rise again. Thy mother's poison'd.
LAERTES	I can no more. The king, the king's to blame.
LAERTES	He is justly serv'd;
LAERTES	It is a poison temper'd by himself.
LAERTES	Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet:
LAERTES	Mine and my father's death come not upon thee,
LAERTES	Nor thine on me!
MACBETH	So foul and fair a day I have not seen.
MACBETH	Speak, if you can: what are you?
MACBETH	Stay, you imperfect speakers, tell me more:
MACBETH	By Sinel's death I know I am Thane of Glamis;
MACBETH	But how of Cawdor? the Thane of Cawdor lives,
MACBETH	A prosperous gentleman; and to be king
MACBETH	Stands not within the prospect of belief
MACBETH	No more than to be Cawdor. Say, from whence
MACBETH	You owe this strange intelligence? or why
MACBETH	Upon this blasted heath you stop our way
MACBETH	With such prophetic greeting? Speak, I charge you.
MACBETH	Into the air, and what seem'd corporal melted
MACBETH	As breath into the wind. Would they had stay'd!
MACBETH	Your children shall be kings.
MACBETH	And Thane of Cawdor too; went it not so?
MACBETH	The Thane of Cawdor lives: why do you dress me
MACBETH	In borrow'd robes?
MACBETH	Glamis, and Thane of Cawdor:
MACBETH	The greatest is behind.
MACBETH	Thanks for your pains.
MACBETH	Do you not hope your children shall be kings,
MACBETH	When those that gave the Thane of Cawdor to me
MACBETH	Promis'd no less to them?
MACBETH	Two truths are told,
MACBETH	As happy prologues to the swelling act
MACBETH	Of the imperial theme. I thank you, gentlemen.
MACBETH	This supernatural soliciting
MACBETH	Cannot be ill, cannot be good; if ill,
MACBETH	Why hath it given me earnest of success,
MACBETH	Commencing in a truth? I am Thane of Cawdor:
MACBETH	If good, why do I yield to that suggestion
MACBETH	Whose horrid image doth unfix my hair
MACBETH	And make my seated heart knock at my ribs,
MACBETH	Against the use of nature? Present fears
MACBETH	Are less than horrible imaginings;
MACBETH	My thought, whose murder yet is but fantastical,
MACBETH	Shakes so my single state of man that function
MACBETH	Is smother'd in surmise, and nothing is
MACBETH	But what is not.
MACBETH	If chance will have me king, why, chance may crown me,
MACBETH	Without my stir.
MACBETH	Come what come may,
MACBETH	Time and the hour runs through the roughest day.
MACBETH	Give me your favour: my dull brain was wrought
MACBETH	With things forgotten. Kind gentlemen, your pains
MACBETH	Are register'd where every day I turn
MACBETH	The leaf to read them. Let us toward the king.
MACBETH	Think upon what hath chanc'd; and, at more time,
MACBETH	The interim having weigh'd it, let us speak
MACBETH	Our free hearts each to other.
MACBETH	Till then, enough. Come, friends.
MACBETH	The service and the loyalty I owe,
MACBETH	In doing it, pays itself. Your highness' part
MACBETH	Is to receive our duties: and our duties
MACBETH	Are to your throne and state, children and servants;
MACBETH	Which do but what they should, by doing everything
MACBETH	Safe toward your love and honour.
MACBETH	The rest is labour, which is not us'd for you:
MACBETH	I'll be myself the harbinger, and make joyful
MACBETH	The hearing of my wife with your approach;
MACBETH	So, humbly take my leave.
MACBETH	The Prince of Cumberland! that is a step
MACBETH	On which I must fall down, or else o'er-leap,
MACBETH	For in my way it lies. Stars, hide your fires!
MACBETH	Let not light see my black and deep desires;
MACBETH	The eye wink at the hand; yet let that be
MACBETH	Which the eye fears, when it is done, to see.
MACBETH	My dearest love,
MACBETH	Duncan comes here to-night.
MACBETH	To-morrow, as he purposes.
MACBETH	We will speak further.
MACBETH	If it were done when 'tis done, then 'twere well
MACBETH	It were done quickly; if the assassination
MACBETH	Could trammel up the consequence, and catch
MACBETH	With his surcease success; that but this blow
MACBETH	Might be the be-all and the end-all here,
MACBETH	But here, upon this bank and shoal of time,
MACBETH	We'd jump the life to come. But in these cases
MACBETH	We still have judgment here; that we but teach
MACBETH	Bloody instructions, which, being taught, return
MACBETH	To plague the inventor; this even-handed justice
MACBETH	Commends the ingredients of our poison'd chalice
MACBETH	To our own lips. He's here in double trust:
MACBETH	First, as I am his kinsman and his subject,
MACBETH	Strong both against the deed; then, as his host,
MACBETH	Who should against his murderer shut the door,
MACBETH	Not bear the knife myself. Besides, this Duncan
MACBETH	Hath borne his faculties so meek, hath been
MACBETH	So clear in his great office, that his virtues
MACBETH	Will plead like angels trumpet-tongu'd against
MACBETH	The deep damnation of his taking-off;
MACBETH	And pity, like a naked new-born babe,
MACBETH	Striding the blast, or heaven's cherubin, hors'd
MACBETH	Upon the sightless couriers of the air,
MACBETH	Shall blow the horrid deed in every eye,
MACBETH	That tears shall drown the wind. I have no spur
MACBETH	To prick the sides of my intent, but only
MACBETH	Vaulting ambition, which o'er-leaps itself
MACBETH	And falls on the other.—
MACBETH	How now! what news?
MACBETH	Hath he ask'd for me?
MACBETH	We will proceed no further in this business:
MACBETH	He hath honour'd me of late; and I have bought
MACBETH	Golden opinions from all sorts of people,
MACBETH	Which would be worn now in their newest gloss,
MACBETH	Not cast aside so soon.
MACBETH	Prithee, peace.
MACBETH	I dare do all that may become a man;
MACBETH	Who dares do more is none.
MACBETH	If we should fail,—
MACBETH	Bring forth men-children only;
MACBETH	For thy undaunted mettle should compose
MACBETH	Nothing but males. Will it not be receiv'd,
MACBETH	When we have mark'd with blood those sleepy two
MACBETH	Of his own chamber and us'd their very daggers,
MACBETH	That they have done't?
MACBETH	I am settled, and bend up
MACBETH	Each corporal agent to this terrible feat.
MACBETH	Away, and mock the time with fairest show:
MACBETH	False face must hide what the false heart doth know.
MACBETH	A friend.
MACBETH	Being unprepar'd,
MACBETH	Our will became the servant to defect,
MACBETH	Which else should free have wrought.
MACBETH	I think not of them:
MACBETH	Yet, when we can entreat an hour to serve,
MACBETH	We would spend it in some words upon that business,
MACBETH	If you would grant the time.
MACBETH	If you shall cleave to my consent, when 'tis,
MACBETH	It shall make honour for you.
MACBETH	Good repose the while!
MACBETH	Go bid thy mistress, when my drink is ready
MACBETH	She strike upon the bell. Get thee to bed.
MACBETH	Is this a dagger which I see before me,
MACBETH	The handle toward my hand? Come, let me clutch thee:
MACBETH	I have thee not, and yet I see thee still.
MACBETH	Art thou not, fatal vision, sensible
MACBETH	To feeling as to sight? or art thou but
MACBETH	A dagger of the mind, a false creation,
MACBETH	Proceeding from the heat-oppressed brain?
MACBETH	I see thee yet, in form as palpable
MACBETH	As this which now I draw.
MACBETH	Thou marshall'st me the way that I was going;
MACBETH	And such an instrument I was to use.
MACBETH	Mine eyes are made the fools o' the other senses,
MACBETH	Or else worth all the rest: I see thee still;
MACBETH	And on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood,
MACBETH	Which was not so before. There's no such thing:
MACBETH	It is the bloody business which informs
MACBETH	Thus to mine eyes. Now o'er the one half-world
MACBETH	Nature seems dead, and wicked dreams abuse
MACBETH	The curtain'd sleep; witchcraft celebrates
MACBETH	Pale Hecate's offerings; and wither'd murder,
MACBETH	Alarum'd by his sentinel, the wolf,
MACBETH	Whose howl's his watch, thus with his stealthy pace,
MACBETH	With Tarquin's ravishing strides, toward his design
MACBETH	Moves like a ghost. Thou sure and firm-set earth,
MACBETH	Hear not my steps, which way they walk, for fear
MACBETH	Thy very stones prate of my whereabout,
MACBETH	And take the present horror from the time,
MACBETH	Which now suits with it. Whiles I threat he lives:
MACBETH	Words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives.
MACBETH	I go, and it is done; the bell invites me.
MACBETH	Hear it not, Duncan; for it is a knell
MACBETH	That summons thee to heaven or to hell.
MACBETH	Who's there? what, ho!
MACBETH	I have done the deed. Didst thou not hear a noise?
MACBETH	When?
MACBETH	As I descended?
MACBETH	Hark!
MACBETH	Who lies i' the second chamber?
MACBETH	This is a sorry sight.
MACBETH	There's one did laugh in 's sleep, and one cried 'Murder!'
MACBETH	That they did wake each other: I stood and heard them;
MACBETH	But they did say their prayers, and address'd them
MACBETH	Again to sleep.
MACBETH	One cried 'God bless us!' and 'Amen' the other:
MACBETH	As they had seen me with these hangman's hands.
MACBETH	Listening their fear, I could not say 'Amen,'
MACBETH	When they did say 'God bless us!'
MACBETH	But wherefore could not I pronounce 'Amen?'
MACBETH	I had most need of blessing, and 'Amen'
MACBETH	Stuck in my throat.
MACBETH	Methought I heard a voice cry 'Sleep no more!
MACBETH	Macbeth does murder sleep,' the innocent sleep,
MACBETH	Sleep that knits up the ravell'd sleave of care,
MACBETH	The death of each day's life, sore labour's bath,
MACBETH	Balm of hurt minds, great nature's second course,
MACBETH	Chief nourisher in life's feast,—
MACBETH	Still it cried, 'Sleep no more!' to all the house:
MACBETH	'Glamis hath murder'd sleep, and therefore Cawdor
MACBETH	Shall sleep no more, Macbeth shall sleep no more!'
MACBETH	I'll go no more:
MACBETH	I am afraid to think what I have done;
MACBETH	Look on 't again I dare not.
MACBETH	Whence is that knocking?
MACBETH	How is't with me, when every noise appals me?
MACBETH	What hands are here! Ha! they pluck out mine eyes.
MACBETH	Will all great Neptune's ocean wash this blood
MACBETH	Clean from my hand? No, this my hand will rather
MACBETH	The multitudinous seas incarnadine,
MACBETH	Making the green one red.
MACBETH	To know my deed 'twere best not know myself.
MACBETH	Wake Duncan with thy knocking! I would thou couldst!
MACBETH	Good morrow, both.
MACBETH	Not yet.
MACBETH	I'll bring you to him.
MACBETH	The labour we delight in physics pain.
MACBETH	This is the door.
MACBETH	He does: he did appoint so.
MACBETH	'Twas a rough night.
MACBETH	What's the matter?
MACBETH	What is 't you say? the life?
MACBETH	Had I but died an hour before this chance
MACBETH	I had liv'd a blessed time; for, from this instant,
MACBETH	There's nothing serious in mortality,
MACBETH	All is but toys; renown and grace is dead,
MACBETH	The wine of life is drawn, and the mere lees
MACBETH	Is left this vault to brag of.
MACBETH	You are, and do not know 't:
MACBETH	The spring, the head, the fountain of your blood
MACBETH	Is stopp'd; the very source of it is stopp'd.
MACBETH	O! yet I do repent me of my fury,
MACBETH	That I did kill them.
MACBETH	Who can be wise, amaz'd, temperate and furious,
MACBETH	Loyal and neutral, in a moment? No man:
MACBETH	The expedition of my violent love
MACBETH	Outran the pauser, reason. Here lay Duncan,
MACBETH	His silver skin lac'd with his golden blood;
MACBETH	And his gash'd stabs look'd like a breach in nature
MACBETH	For ruin's wasteful entrance: there, the murderers,
MACBETH	Steep'd in the colours of their trade, their daggers
MACBETH	Unmannerly breech'd with gore: who could refrain,
MACBETH	That had a heart to love, and in that heart
MACBETH	Courage to make 's love known?
MACBETH	Let's briefly put on manly readiness,
MACBETH	And meet i' the hall together.
MACBETH	Here's our chief guest.
MACBETH	To-night we hold a solemn supper, sir,
MACBETH	And I'll request your presence.
MACBETH	Ride you this afternoon?
MACBETH	We should have else desir'd your good advice—
MACBETH	Which still hath been both grave and prosperous—
MACBETH	In this day's council; but we'll take to-morrow.
MACBETH	Is 't far you ride?
MACBETH	Fail not our feast.
MACBETH	We hear our bloody cousins are bestow'd
MACBETH	In England and in Ireland, not confessing
MACBETH	Their cruel parricide, filling their hearers
MACBETH	With strange invention; but of that to-morrow,
MACBETH	When therewithal we shall have cause of state
MACBETH	Craving us jointly. Hie you to horse; adieu
MACBETH	Till you return at night. Goes Fleance with you?
MACBETH	I wish your horses swift and sure of foot;
MACBETH	And so I do commend you to their backs.
MACBETH	Farewell.
MACBETH	Let every man be master of his time
MACBETH	Till seven at night; to make society
MACBETH	The sweeter welcome, we will keep ourself
MACBETH	Till supper-time alone; while then, God be with you!
MACBETH	Sirrah, a word with you. Attend those men
MACBETH	Our pleasure?
MACBETH	Bring them before us.
MACBETH	To be thus is nothing;
MACBETH	But to be safely thus. Our fears in Banquo
MACBETH	Stick deep, and in his royalty of nature
MACBETH	Reigns that which would be fear'd: 'tis much he dares,
MACBETH	And, to that dauntless temper of his mind,
MACBETH	He hath a wisdom that doth guide his valour
MACBETH	To act in safety. There is none but he
MACBETH	Whose being I do fear; and under him
MACBETH	My genius is rebuk'd, as it is said
MACBETH	Mark Antony's was by Cæsar. He chid the sisters
MACBETH	When first they put the name of king upon me,
MACBETH	And bade them speak to him; then, prophet-like,
MACBETH	They hail'd him father to a line of kings.
MACBETH	Upon my head they plac'd a fruitless crown,
MACBETH	And put a barren sceptre in my gripe,
MACBETH	Thence to be wrench'd with an unlineal hand,
MACBETH	No son of mine succeeding. If 't be so,
MACBETH	For Banquo's issue have I fil'd my mind;
MACBETH	For them the gracious Duncan have I murder'd;
MACBETH	Put rancours in the vessel of my peace
MACBETH	Only for them; and mine eternal jewel
MACBETH	Given to the common enemy of man,
MACBETH	To make them kings, the seed of Banquo kings!
MACBETH	Rather than so, come fate into the list,
MACBETH	And champion me to the utterance! Who's there?
MACBETH	Now go to the door, and stay there till we call.
MACBETH	Was it not yesterday we spoke together?
MACBETH	Well then, now
MACBETH	Have you consider'd of my speeches? Know
MACBETH	That it was he in the times past which held you
MACBETH	So under fortune, which you thought had been
MACBETH	Our innocent self. This I made good to you
MACBETH	In our last conference, pass'd in probation with you,
MACBETH	How you were borne in hand, how cross'd, the instruments,
MACBETH	Who wrought with them, and all things else that might
MACBETH	To half a soul and to a notion craz'd
MACBETH	Say, 'Thus did Banquo.'
MACBETH	I did so; and went further, which is now
MACBETH	Our point of second meeting. Do you find
MACBETH	Your patience so predominant in your nature
MACBETH	That you can let this go? Are you so gospell'd
MACBETH	To pray for this good man and for his issue,
MACBETH	Whose heavy hand hath bow'd you to the grave
MACBETH	And beggar'd yours for ever?
MACBETH	Ay, in the catalogue ye go for men;
MACBETH	As hounds and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, curs,
MACBETH	Shoughs, water-rugs, and demi-wolves, are clept
MACBETH	All by the name of dogs: the valu'd file
MACBETH	Distinguishes the swift, the slow, the subtle,
MACBETH	The housekeeper, the hunter, every one
MACBETH	According to the gift which bounteous nature
MACBETH	Hath in him clos'd; whereby he does receive
MACBETH	Particular addition, from the bill
MACBETH	That writes them all alike: and so of men.
MACBETH	Now, if you have a station in the file,
MACBETH	Not i' the worst rank of manhood, say it;
MACBETH	And I will put that business in your bosoms,
MACBETH	Whose execution takes your enemy off,
MACBETH	Grapples you to the heart and love of us,
MACBETH	Who wear our health but sickly in his life,
MACBETH	Which in his death were perfect.
MACBETH	Both of you
MACBETH	Know Banquo was your enemy.
MACBETH	So is he mine; and in such bloody distance
MACBETH	That every minute of his being thrusts
MACBETH	Against my near'st of life: and though I could
MACBETH	With bare-fac'd power sweep him from my sight
MACBETH	And bid my will avouch it, yet I must not,
MACBETH	For certain friends that are both his and mine,
MACBETH	Whose loves I may not drop, but wail his fall
MACBETH	Whom I myself struck down; and thence it is
MACBETH	That I to your assistance do make love,
MACBETH	Masking the business from the common eye
MACBETH	For sundry weighty reasons.
MACBETH	Your spirits shine through you. Within this hour at most
MACBETH	I will advise you where to plant yourselves,
MACBETH	Acquaint you with the perfect spy o' the time,
MACBETH	The moment on 't; for 't must be done to-night,
MACBETH	And something from the palace; always thought
MACBETH	That I require a clearness: and with him—
MACBETH	To leave no rubs nor botches in the work—
MACBETH	Fleance his son, that keeps him company,
MACBETH	Whose absence is no less material to me
MACBETH	Than is his father's, must embrace the fate
MACBETH	Of that dark hour. Resolve yourselves apart;
MACBETH	I'll come to you anon.
MACBETH	I'll call upon you straight: abide within.
MACBETH	It is concluded: Banquo, thy soul's flight,
MACBETH	If it find heaven, must find it out to-night.
MACBETH	We have scotch'd the snake, not kill'd it:
MACBETH	She'll close and be herself, whilst our poor malice
MACBETH	Remains in danger of her former tooth.
MACBETH	But let the frame of things disjoint, both the worlds suffer,
MACBETH	Ere we will eat our meal in fear, and sleep
MACBETH	In the affliction of these terrible dreams
MACBETH	That shake us nightly. Better be with the dead,
MACBETH	Whom we, to gain our peace, have sent to peace,
MACBETH	Than on the torture of the mind to lie
MACBETH	In restless ecstasy. Duncan is in his grave;
MACBETH	After life's fitful fever he sleeps well;
MACBETH	Treason has done his worst: nor steel, nor poison,
MACBETH	Malice domestic, foreign levy, nothing
MACBETH	Can touch him further.
MACBETH	So shall I, love; and so, I pray, be you.
MACBETH	Let your remembrance apply to Banquo;
MACBETH	Present him eminence, both with eye and tongue:
MACBETH	Unsafe the while, that we
MACBETH	Must lave our honours in these flattering streams,
MACBETH	And make our faces vizards to our hearts,
MACBETH	Disguising what they are.
MACBETH	O! full of scorpions is my mind, dear wife;
MACBETH	Thou know'st that Banquo and his Fleance lives.
MACBETH	There's comfort yet; they are assailable;
MACBETH	Then be thou jocund. Ere the bat hath flown
MACBETH	His cloister'd flight, ere, to black Hecate's summons
MACBETH	The shard-borne beetle with his drowsy hums
MACBETH	Hath rung night's yawning peal, there shall be done
MACBETH	A deed of dreadful note.
MACBETH	Be innocent of the knowledge, dearest chuck,
MACBETH	Till thou applaud the deed. Come, seeling night,
MACBETH	Scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day,
MACBETH	And with thy bloody and invisible hand
MACBETH	Cancel and tear to pieces that great bond
MACBETH	Which keeps me pale! Light thickens, and the crow
MACBETH	Makes wing to the rooky wood;
MACBETH	Good things of day begin to droop and drowse,
MACBETH	Whiles night's black agents to their preys do rouse.
MACBETH	Thou marvell'st at my words: but hold thee still;
MACBETH	Things bad begun make strong themselves by ill:
MACBETH	So, prithee, go with me.
MACBETH	You know your own degrees; sit down: at first and last,
MACBETH	The hearty welcome.
MACBETH	Ourself will mingle with society
MACBETH	And play the humble host.
MACBETH	Our hostess keeps her state, but in best time
MACBETH	We will require her welcome.
MACBETH	See, they encounter thee with their hearts' thanks;
MACBETH	Both sides are even: here I'll sit i' the midst:
MACBETH	Be large in mirth; anon, we'll drink a measure
MACBETH	The table round.
MACBETH	There's blood upon thy face.
MACBETH	'Tis better thee without than he within.
MACBETH	Is he dispatch'd?
MACBETH	Thou art the best o' the cut-throats; yet he's good
MACBETH	That did the like for Fleance: if thou didst it,
MACBETH	Thou art the nonpareil.
MACBETH	Then comes my fit again: I had else been perfect;
MACBETH	Whole as the marble, founded as the rock,
MACBETH	As broad and general as the casing air:
MACBETH	But now I am cabin'd, cribb'd, confin'd, bound in
MACBETH	To saucy doubts and fears. But Banquo's safe?
MACBETH	Thanks for that.
MACBETH	There the grown serpent lies: the worm that's fled
MACBETH	Hath nature that in time will venom breed,
MACBETH	No teeth for the present. Get thee gone; to-morrow
MACBETH	We'll hear ourselves again.
MACBETH	Sweet remembrancer!
MACBETH	Now good digestion wait on appetite,
MACBETH	And health on both!
MACBETH	Here had we now our country's honour roof'd,
MACBETH	Were the grac'd person of our Banquo present;
MACBETH	Who may I rather challenge for unkindness
MACBETH	Than pity for mischance!
MACBETH	The table's full.
MACBETH	Where?
MACBETH	Which of you have done this?
MACBETH	Thou canst not say I did it: never shake
MACBETH	Thy gory locks at me.
MACBETH	Ay, and a bold one, that dare look on that
MACBETH	Which might appal the devil.
MACBETH	Prithee, see there! behold! look! lo! how say you?
MACBETH	Why, what care I? If thou canst nod, speak too.
MACBETH	If charnel-houses and our graves must send
MACBETH	Those that we bury back, our monuments
MACBETH	Shall be the maws of kites.
MACBETH	If I stand here, I saw him.
MACBETH	Blood hath been shed ere now, i' the olden time,
MACBETH	Ere human statute purg'd the gentle weal;
MACBETH	Ay, and since too, murders have been perform'd
MACBETH	Too terrible for the ear: the times have been,
MACBETH	That, when the brains were out, the man would die,
MACBETH	And there an end; but now they rise again,
MACBETH	With twenty mortal murders on their crowns,
MACBETH	And push us from our stools: this is more strange
MACBETH	Than such a murder is.
MACBETH	I do forget.
MACBETH	Do not muse at me, my most worthy friends;
MACBETH	I have a strange infirmity, which is nothing
MACBETH	To those that know me. Come, love and health to all;
MACBETH	Then, I'll sit down. Give me some wine; fill full.
MACBETH	I drink to the general joy of the whole table,
MACBETH	And to our dear friend Banquo, whom we miss;
MACBETH	Would he were here! to all, and him, we thirst,
MACBETH	And all to all.
MACBETH	Avaunt! and quit my sight! Let the earth hide thee!
MACBETH	Thy bones are marrowless, thy blood is cold;
MACBETH	Thou hast no speculation in those eyes
MACBETH	Which thou dost glare with.
MACBETH	What man dare, I dare:
MACBETH	Approach thou like the rugged Russian bear,
MACBETH	The arm'd rhinoceros, or the Hyrcan tiger;
MACBETH	Take any shape but that, and my firm nerves
MACBETH	Shall never tremble: or be alive again,
MACBETH	And dare me to the desart with thy sword;
MACBETH	If trembling I inhabit then, protest me
MACBETH	The baby of a girl. Hence, horrible shadow!
MACBETH	Unreal mockery, hence!
MACBETH	Why, so; being gone,
MACBETH	I am a man again. Pray you, sit still.
MACBETH	Can such things be
MACBETH	And overcome us like a summer's cloud,
MACBETH	Without our special wonder? You make me strange
MACBETH	Even to the disposition that I owe,
MACBETH	When now I think you can behold such sights,
MACBETH	And keep the natural ruby of your cheeks,
MACBETH	When mine are blanch'd with fear.
MACBETH	It will have blood, they say; blood will have blood:
MACBETH	Stones have been known to move and trees to speak;
MACBETH	Augurs and understood relations have
MACBETH	By maggot-pies and choughs and rooks brought forth
MACBETH	The secret'st man of blood. What is the night?
MACBETH	How sayst thou, that Macduff denies his person
MACBETH	At our great bidding?
MACBETH	I hear it by the way; but I will send.
MACBETH	There's not a one of them but in his house
MACBETH	I keep a servant fee'd. I will to-morrow—
MACBETH	And betimes I will—to the weird sisters:
MACBETH	More shall they speak; for now I am bent to know,
MACBETH	By the worst means, the worst. For mine own good
MACBETH	All causes shall give way: I am in blood
MACBETH	Stepp'd in so far, that, should I wade no more,
MACBETH	Returning were as tedious as go o'er.
MACBETH	Strange things I have in head that will to hand,
MACBETH	Which must be acted ere they may be scann'd.
MACBETH	Come, we'll to sleep. My strange and self-abuse
MACBETH	Is the initiate fear that wants hard use:
MACBETH	We are yet but young in deed.
MACBETH	How now, you secret, black, and mid-night hags!
MACBETH	What is 't you do?
MACBETH	I conjure you, by that which you profess,—
MACBETH	Howe'er you come to know it,—answer me:
MACBETH	Though you untie the winds and let them fight
MACBETH	Against the churches; though the yesty waves
MACBETH	Confound and swallow navigation up;
MACBETH	Though bladed corn be lodg'd and trees blown down;
MACBETH	Though castles topple on their warders' heads;
MACBETH	Though palaces and pyramids do slope
MACBETH	Their heads to their foundations; though the treasure
MACBETH	Of Nature's germens tumble all together,
MACBETH	Even till destruction sicken; answer me
MACBETH	To what I ask you.
MACBETH	Call 'em: let me see 'em.
MACBETH	Tell me, thou unknown power,—
MACBETH	Whate'er thou art, for thy good caution thanks;
MACBETH	Thou hast harp'd my fear aright. But one word more,—
MACBETH	Had I three ears, I'd hear thee.
MACBETH	Then live, Macduff: what need I fear of thee?
MACBETH	But yet I'll make assurance double sure,
MACBETH	And take a bond of fate: thou shalt not live;
MACBETH	That I may tell pale-hearted fear it lies,
MACBETH	And sleep in spite of thunder.
MACBETH	What is this,
MACBETH	That rises like the issue of a king,
MACBETH	And wears upon his baby brow the round
MACBETH	And top of sovereignty?
MACBETH	That will never be:
MACBETH	Who can impress the forest, bid the tree
MACBETH	Unfix his earth-bound root? Sweet bodements! good!
MACBETH	Rebellion's head, rise never till the wood
MACBETH	Of Birnam rise, and our high-plac'd Macbeth
MACBETH	Shall live the lease of nature, pay his breath
MACBETH	To time and mortal custom. Yet my heart
MACBETH	Throbs to know one thing: tell me—if your art
MACBETH	Can tell so much,—shall Banquo's issue ever
MACBETH	Reign in this kingdom?
MACBETH	I will be satisfied: deny me this,
MACBETH	And an eternal curse fall on you! Let me know.
MACBETH	Why sinks that cauldron? and what noise is this?
MACBETH	Thou art too like the spirit of Banquo; down!
MACBETH	Thy crown does sear mine eyeballs: and thy hair,
MACBETH	Thou other gold-bound brow, is like the first:
MACBETH	A third is like the former. Filthy hags!
MACBETH	Why do you show me this? A fourth! Start, eyes!
MACBETH	What! will the line stretch out to the crack of doom?
MACBETH	Another yet? A seventh! I'll see no more:
MACBETH	And yet the eighth appears, who bears a glass
MACBETH	Which shows me many more; and some I see
MACBETH	That two-fold balls and treble sceptres carry.
MACBETH	Horrible sight! Now, I see, 'tis true;
MACBETH	For the blood-bolter'd Banquo smiles upon me,
MACBETH	And points at them for his.
MACBETH	What! is this so?
MACBETH	Where are they? Gone? Let this pernicious hour
MACBETH	Stand aye accursed in the calendar!
MACBETH	Come in, without there!
MACBETH	Saw you the weird sisters?
MACBETH	Came they not by you?
MACBETH	Infected be the air whereon they ride,
MACBETH	And damn'd all those that trust them! I did hear
MACBETH	The galloping of horse: who was 't came by?
MACBETH	Fled to England!
MACBETH	Time, thou anticipat'st my dread exploits;
MACBETH	The flighty purpose never is o'ertook
MACBETH	Unless the deed go with it; from this moment
MACBETH	The very firstlings of my heart shall be
MACBETH	The firstlings of my hand. And even now,
MACBETH	To crown my thoughts with acts, be it thought and done:
MACBETH	The castle of Macduff I will surprise;
MACBETH	Seize upon Fife; give to the edge of the sword
MACBETH	His wife, his babes, and all unfortunate souls
MACBETH	That trace him in his line. No boasting like a fool;
MACBETH	This deed I'll do, before this purpose cool:
MACBETH	But no moresights! Where are these gentlemen?
MACBETH	Come, bring me where they are.
MACBETH	Bring me no more reports; let them fly all:
MACBETH	Till Birnam wood remove to Dunsinane
MACBETH	I cannot taint with fear. What's the boy Malcolm?
MACBETH	Was he not born of woman? The spirits that know
MACBETH	All mortal consequences have pronounc'd me thus:
MACBETH	'Fear not, Macbeth; no man that's born of woman
MACBETH	Shall e'er have power upon thee.' Then fly, false thanes,
MACBETH	And mingle with the English epicures:
MACBETH	The mind I sway by and the heart I bear
MACBETH	Shall never sag with doubt nor shake with fear.
MACBETH	The devil damn thee black, thou cream-fac'd loon!
MACBETH	Where gott'st thou that goose look?
MACBETH	Geese, villain?
MACBETH	Go, prick thy face, and over-red thy fear,
MACBETH	Thou lily-liver'd boy. What soldiers, patch?
MACBETH	Death of thy soul! those linen cheeks of thine
MACBETH	Are counsellors to fear. What soldiers, wheyface?
MACBETH	Take thy face hence.
MACBETH	Seyton!—I am sick at heart
MACBETH	When I behold—Seyton, I say!—This push
MACBETH	Will cheer me ever or disseat me now.
MACBETH	I have liv'd long enough: my way of life
MACBETH	Is fall'n into the sear, the yellow leaf;
MACBETH	And that which should accompany old age,
MACBETH	As honour, love, obedience, troops of friends,
MACBETH	I must not look to have; but, in their stead,
MACBETH	Curses, not loud but deep, mouth-honour, breath,
MACBETH	Which the poor heart would fain deny, and dare not.
MACBETH	Seyton!
MACBETH	What news more?
MACBETH	I'll fight till from my bones my flesh be hack'd.
MACBETH	Give me my armour.
MACBETH	I'll put it on.
MACBETH	Send out more horses, skirr the country round;
MACBETH	Hang those that talk of fear. Give me mine armour.
MACBETH	How does your patient, doctor?
MACBETH	Cure her of that:
MACBETH	Canst thou not minister to a mind diseas'd,
MACBETH	Pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow,
MACBETH	Raze out the written troubles of the brain,
MACBETH	And with some sweet oblivious antidote
MACBETH	Cleanse the stuff'd bosom of that perilous stuff
MACBETH	Which weighs upon the heart?
MACBETH	Throw physic to the dogs; I'll none of it.
MACBETH	Come, put mine armour on; give me my staff.
MACBETH	Seyton, send out.—Doctor, the thanes fly from me.—
MACBETH	Come, sir, dispatch.—If thou couldst, doctor, cast
MACBETH	The water of my land, find her disease,
MACBETH	And purge it to a sound and pristine health,
MACBETH	I would applaud thee to the very echo,
MACBETH	That should applaud again.—Pull 't off, I say.—
MACBETH	What rhubarb, senna, or what purgative drug
MACBETH	Would scour these English hence? Hear'st thou of them?
MACBETH	Bring it after me.
MACBETH	I will not be afraid of death and bane
MACBETH	Till Birnam forest come to Dunsinane.
MACBETH	Hang out our banners on the outward walls;
MACBETH	The cry is still, 'They come;' our castle's strength
MACBETH	Will laugh a siege to scorn; here let them lie
MACBETH	Till famine and the ague eat them up;
MACBETH	Were they not forc'd with those that should be ours,
MACBETH	We might have met them dareful, beard to beard,
MACBETH	And beat them backward home.
MACBETH	What is that noise?
MACBETH	I have almost forgot the taste of fears.
MACBETH	The time has been my senses would have cool'd
MACBETH	To hear a night-shriek, and my fell of hair
MACBETH	Would at a dismal treatise rouse and stir
MACBETH	As life were in 't. I have supp'd full with horrors;
MACBETH	Direness, familiar to my slaughterous thoughts,
MACBETH	Cannot once start me.
MACBETH	Wherefore was that cry?
MACBETH	She should have died hereafter;
MACBETH	There would have been a time for such a word.
MACBETH	To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow,
MACBETH	Creeps in this petty pace from day to day,
MACBETH	To the last syllable of recorded time;
MACBETH	And all our yesterdays have lighted fools
MACBETH	The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!
MACBETH	Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player
MACBETH	That struts and frets his hour upon the stage,
MACBETH	And then is heard no more; it is a tale
MACBETH	Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,
MACBETH	Signifying nothing.
MACBETH	Thou com'st to use thy tongue; thy story quickly.
MACBETH	Well, say, sir.
MACBETH	Liar and slave!
MACBETH	If thou speak'st false,
MACBETH	Upon the next tree shalt thou hang alive,
MACBETH	Till famine cling thee; if thy speech be sooth,
MACBETH	I care not if thou dost for me as much.
MACBETH	I pull in resolution and begin
MACBETH	To doubt the equivocation of the fiend
MACBETH	That lies like truth; 'Fear not, till Birnam wood
MACBETH	Do come to Dunsinane;' and now a wood
MACBETH	Comes toward Dunsinane. Arm, arm, and out!
MACBETH	If this which he avouches does appear,
MACBETH	There is nor flying hence, nor tarrying here.
MACBETH	I 'gin to be aweary of the sun,
MACBETH	And wish the estate o' the world were now undone.
MACBETH	Ring the alarum-bell! Blow, wind! come, wrack!
MACBETH	At least we'll die with harness on our back.
MACBETH	They have tied me to a stake; I cannot fly,
MACBETH	But bear-like I must fight the course. What's he
MACBETH	That was not born of woman? Such a one
MACBETH	Am I to fear, or none.
MACBETH	Thou'lt be afraid to hear it.
MACBETH	My name's Macbeth.
MACBETH	No, nor more fearful.
MACBETH	Thou wast born of woman:
MACBETH	But swords I smile at, weapons laugh to scorn,
MACBETH	Brandish'd by man that's of a woman born.
MACBETH	Why should I play the Roman fool, and die
MACBETH	On mine own sword? whiles I see lives, the gashes
MACBETH	Do better upon them.
MACBETH	Of all men else I have avoided thee:
MACBETH	But get thee back, my soul is too much charg'd
MACBETH	With blood of thine already.
MACBETH	Thou losest labour:
MACBETH	As easy mayst thou the intrenchant air
MACBETH	With thy keen sword impress as make me bleed:
MACBETH	Let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests;
MACBETH	I bear a charmed life, which must not yield
MACBETH	To one of woman born.
MACBETH	Accursed be that tongue that tells me so,
MACBETH	For it hath cow'd my better part of man:
MACBETH	And be these juggling fiends no more believ'd,
MACBETH	That palter with us in a double sense;
MACBETH	That keep the word of promise to our ear,
MACBETH	And break it to our hope. I'll not fight with thee.
MACBETH	I will not yield,
MACBETH	To kiss the ground before young Malcolm's feet,
MACBETH	And to be baited with the rabble's curse.
MACBETH	Though Birnam wood be come to Dunsinane,
MACBETH	And thou oppos'd, being of no woman born,
MACBETH	Yet I will try the last: before my body
MACBETH	I throw my war-like shield. Lay on, Macduff,
MACBETH	And damn'd be him that first cries, 'Hold, enough!'
MACDUFF	Was it so late, friend, ere you went to bed,
MACDUFF	That you do lie so late?
MACDUFF	What three things does drink especially provoke?
MACDUFF	I believe drink gave thee the lie last night.
MACDUFF	Is thy master stirring?
MACDUFF	Our knocking has awak'd him; here he comes.
MACDUFF	Is the king stirring, worthy thane?
MACDUFF	He did command me to call timely on him:
MACDUFF	I have almost slipp'd the hour.
MACDUFF	I know this is a joyful trouble to you;
MACDUFF	But yet 'tis one.
MACDUFF	I'll make so bold to call,
MACDUFF	For 'tis my limited service.
MACDUFF	O horror! horror! horror! Tongue nor heart
MACDUFF	Cannot conceive nor name thee!
MACDUFF	Confusion now hath made his masterpiece!
MACDUFF	Most sacrilegious murder hath broke ope
MACDUFF	The Lord's anointed temple, and stole thence
MACDUFF	The life o' the building!
MACDUFF	Approach the chamber, and destroy your sight
MACDUFF	With a new Gorgon: do not bid me speak;
MACDUFF	See, and then speak yourselves.
MACDUFF	Awake! awake!
MACDUFF	Ring the alarum-bell. Murder and treason!
MACDUFF	Banquo and Donalbain! Malcolm! awake!
MACDUFF	Shake off this downy sleep, death's counterfeit,
MACDUFF	And look on death itself! up, up, and see
MACDUFF	The great doom's image! Malcolm! Banquo!
MACDUFF	As from your graves rise up, and walk like sprites,
MACDUFF	To countenance this horror! Ring the bell.
MACDUFF	O gentle lady!
MACDUFF	'Tis not for you to hear what I can speak;
MACDUFF	The repetition in a woman's ear
MACDUFF	Would murder as it fell.
MACDUFF	O Banquo! Banquo!
MACDUFF	Our royal master's murder'd!
MACDUFF	Your royal father's murder'd.
MACDUFF	Wherefore did you so?
MACDUFF	Look to the lady.
MACDUFF	And so do I.
MACDUFF	Why, see you not?
MACDUFF	Those that Macbeth hath slain.
MACDUFF	They were suborn'd.
MACDUFF	Malcolm and Donalbain, the king's two sons,
MACDUFF	Are stol'n away and fled, which puts upon them
MACDUFF	Suspicion of the deed.
MACDUFF	He is already nam'd, and gone to Scone
MACDUFF	To be invested.
MACDUFF	Carried to Colmekill;
MACDUFF	The sacred storehouse of his predecessors
MACDUFF	And guardian of their bones.
MACDUFF	No, cousin, I'll to Fife.
MACDUFF	Well, may you see things well done there: adieu!
MACDUFF	Lest our old robes sit easier than our new!
MACDUFF	Let us rather
MACDUFF	Hold fast the mortal sword, and like good men
MACDUFF	Bestride our down-fall'n birthdom; each new morn
MACDUFF	New widowshowl, new orphans cry, new sorrows
MACDUFF	Strike heaven on the face, that it resounds
MACDUFF	As if it felt with Scotland and yell'd out
MACDUFF	Like syllable of dolour.
MACDUFF	I am not treacherous.
MACDUFF	I have lost my hopes.
MACDUFF	Bleed, bleed, poor country!
MACDUFF	Great tyranny, lay thou thy basis sure,
MACDUFF	For goodness dares not check thee! wear thou thy wrongs;
MACDUFF	The title is affeer'd! Fare thee well, lord:
MACDUFF	I would not be the villain that thou think'st
MACDUFF	For the whole space that's in the tyrant's grasp,
MACDUFF	And the rich East to boot.
MACDUFF	What should he be?
MACDUFF	Not in the legions
MACDUFF	Of horrid hell can come a devil more damn'd
MACDUFF	In evils to top Macbeth.
MACDUFF	Boundless intemperance
MACDUFF	In nature is a tyranny; it hath been
MACDUFF	Th' untimely emptying of the happy throne,
MACDUFF	And fall of many kings. But fear not yet
MACDUFF	To take upon you what is yours; you may
MACDUFF	Convey your pleasures in a spacious plenty,
MACDUFF	And yet seem cold, the time you may so hoodwink.
MACDUFF	We have willing dames enough; there cannot be
MACDUFF	That vulture in you, to devour so many
MACDUFF	As will to greatness dedicate themselves,
MACDUFF	Finding it so inclin'd.
MACDUFF	This avarice
MACDUFF	Sticks deeper, grows with more pernicious root
MACDUFF	Than summer-seeming lust, and it hath been
MACDUFF	The sword of our slain kings: yet do not fear;
MACDUFF	Scotland hath foisons to fill up your will,
MACDUFF	Of your mere own; all these are portable,
MACDUFF	With other graces weigh'd.
MACDUFF	O Scotland, Scotland!
MACDUFF	Fit to govern!
MACDUFF	No, not to live. O nation miserable,
MACDUFF	With an untitled tyrant bloody-scepter'd,
MACDUFF	When shalt thou see thy wholesome days again,
MACDUFF	Since that the truest issue of thy throne
MACDUFF	By his own interdiction stands accurs'd,
MACDUFF	And does blaspheme his breed? Thy royal father
MACDUFF	Was a most sainted king; the queen that bore thee,
MACDUFF	Oft'ner upon her knees than on her feet,
MACDUFF	Died every day she liv'd. Fare thee well!
MACDUFF	These evils thou repeat'st upon thyself
MACDUFF	Have banish'd me from Scotland. O my breast,
MACDUFF	Thy hope ends here!
MACDUFF	Such welcome and unwelcome things at once
MACDUFF	'Tis hard to reconcile.
MACDUFF	What's the disease he means?
MACDUFF	See, who comes here?
MACDUFF	My ever-gentle cousin, welcome hither.
MACDUFF	Stands Scotland where it did?
MACDUFF	O! relation
MACDUFF	Too nice, and yet too true!
MACDUFF	How does my wife?
MACDUFF	And all my children?
MACDUFF	The tyrant has not batter'd at their peace?
MACDUFF	Be not a niggard of your speech: how goes 't?
MACDUFF	What concern they?
MACDUFF	The general cause? or is it a fee-grief
MACDUFF	Due to some single breast?
MACDUFF	If it be mine
MACDUFF	Keep it not from me; quickly let me have it.
MACDUFF	Hum! I guess at it.
MACDUFF	My children too?
MACDUFF	And I must be from thence!
MACDUFF	My wife kill'd too?
MACDUFF	He has no children. All my pretty ones?
MACDUFF	Did you say all? O hell-kite! All?
MACDUFF	What! all my pretty chickens and their dam
MACDUFF	At one fell swoop?
MACDUFF	I shall do so;
MACDUFF	But I must also feel it as a man:
MACDUFF	I cannot but remember such things were,
MACDUFF	That were most precious to me. Did heaven look on,
MACDUFF	And would not take their part? Sinful Macduff!
MACDUFF	They were all struck for thee. Naught that I am,
MACDUFF	Not for their own demerits, but for mine,
MACDUFF	Fell slaughter on their souls. Heaven rest them now!
MACDUFF	O! I could play the woman with mine eyes,
MACDUFF	And braggart with my tongue. But, gentle heavens,
MACDUFF	Cut short all intermission; front to front
MACDUFF	Bring thou this fiend of Scotland and myself;
MACDUFF	Within my sword's length set him; if he 'scape,
MACDUFF	Heaven forgive him too!
MACDUFF	Let our just censures
MACDUFF	Attend the true event, and put we on
MACDUFF	Industrious soldiership.
MACDUFF	Make all our trumpets speak; give them all breath,
MACDUFF	Those clamorous harbingers of blood and death.
MACDUFF	That way the noise is. Tyrant, show thy face:
MACDUFF	If thou be'st slain and with no stroke of mine,
MACDUFF	My wife and children's ghosts will haunt me still.
MACDUFF	I cannot strike at wretched kerns, whose arms
MACDUFF	Are hir'd to bear their staves: either thou, Macbeth,
MACDUFF	Or else my sword with an unbatter'd edge
MACDUFF	I sheathe again undeeded. There thou shouldst be;
MACDUFF	By this great clatter, one of greatest note
MACDUFF	Seems bruited. Let me find him, fortune!
MACDUFF	And more I beg not.
MACDUFF	Turn, hell-hound, turn!
MACDUFF	I have no words;
MACDUFF	My voice is in my sword, thou bloodier villain
MACDUFF	Than terms can give thee out!
MACDUFF	Despair thy charm;
MACDUFF	And let the angel whom thou still hast serv'd
MACDUFF	Tell thee, Macduff was from his mother's womb
MACDUFF	Untimely ripp'd.
MACDUFF	Then yield thee, coward,
MACDUFF	And live to be the show and gaze o' the time:
MACDUFF	We'll have thee, as our rarer monsters are,
MACDUFF	Painted upon a pole, and underwrit,
MACDUFF	'Here may you see the tyrant.'
MACDUFF	Hail, king! for so thou art. Behold, where stands
MACDUFF	The usurper's cursed head: the time is free:
MACDUFF	I see thee compass'd with thy kingdom's pearl,
MACDUFF	That speak my salutation in their minds;
MACDUFF	Whose voices I desire aloud with mine;
MACDUFF	Hail, King of Scotland!
MALCOLM	This is the sergeant
MALCOLM	Who, like a good and hardy soldier fought
MALCOLM	'Gainst my captivity. Hail, brave friend!
MALCOLM	Say to the king the knowledge of the broil
MALCOLM	As thou didst leave it.
MALCOLM	The worthy Thane of Ross.
MALCOLM	My liege,
MALCOLM	They are not yet come back; but I have spoke
MALCOLM	With one that saw him die; who did report
MALCOLM	That very frankly he confess'd his treasons,
MALCOLM	Implor'd your highness' pardon and set forth
MALCOLM	A deep repentance. Nothing in his life
MALCOLM	Became him like the leaving it; he died
MALCOLM	As one that had been studied in his death
MALCOLM	To throw away the dearest thing he ow'd,
MALCOLM	As 'twere a careless trifle.
MALCOLM	O! by whom?
MALCOLM	Why do we hold our tongues,
MALCOLM	That most may claim this argument for ours:
MALCOLM	Nor our strong sorrow
MALCOLM	Upon the foot of motion.
MALCOLM	What will you do? Let's not consort with them:
MALCOLM	To show an unfelt sorrow is an office
MALCOLM	Which the false man does easy. I'll to England.
MALCOLM	This murderous shaft that's shot
MALCOLM	Hath not yet lighted, and our safest way
MALCOLM	Is to avoid the aim: therefore, to horse;
MALCOLM	And let us not be dainty of leave-taking,
MALCOLM	But shift away: there's warrant in that theft
MALCOLM	Which steals itself when there's no mercy left.
MALCOLM	Let us seek out some desolate shade, and there
MALCOLM	Weep our sad bosoms empty.
MALCOLM	What I believe I'll wail,
MALCOLM	What know believe, and what I can redress,
MALCOLM	As I shall find the time to friend, I will.
MALCOLM	What you have spoke, it may be so perchance.
MALCOLM	This tyrant, whosesole name blisters our tongues,
MALCOLM	Was once thought honest: you have lov'd him well;
MALCOLM	He hath not touch'd you yet. I am young; but something
MALCOLM	You may deserve of him through me, and wisdom
MALCOLM	To offer up a weak, poor, innocent lamb
MALCOLM	To appease an angry god.
MALCOLM	But Macbeth is.
MALCOLM	A good and virtuous nature may recoil
MALCOLM	In an imperial charge. But I shall crave your pardon;
MALCOLM	That which you are my thoughts cannot transpose;
MALCOLM	Angels are bright still, though the brightest fell;
MALCOLM	Though all things foul would wear the brows of grace,
MALCOLM	Yet grace must still look so.
MALCOLM	Perchance even there where I did find my doubts.
MALCOLM	Why in that rawness left you wife and child—
MALCOLM	Those precious motives, those strong knots of love—
MALCOLM	Without leave-taking? I pray you,
MALCOLM	Let not my jealousies be your dishonours,
MALCOLM	But mine own safeties: you may be rightly just,
MALCOLM	Whatever I shall think.
MALCOLM	Be not offended:
MALCOLM	I speak not as in absolute fear of you.
MALCOLM	I think our country sinks beneath the yoke;
MALCOLM	It weeps, it bleeds, and each new day a gash
MALCOLM	Is added to her wounds: I think withal,
MALCOLM	There would be hands uplifted in my right;
MALCOLM	And here from gracious England have I offer
MALCOLM	Of goodly thousands: but, for all this,
MALCOLM	When I shall tread upon the tyrant's head,
MALCOLM	Or wear it on my sword, yet my poor country
MALCOLM	Shall have more vices than it had before,
MALCOLM	More suffer, and more sundry ways than ever,
MALCOLM	By him that shall succeed.
MALCOLM	It is myself I mean; in whom I know
MALCOLM	All the particulars of vice so grafted,
MALCOLM	That, when they shall be open'd, black Macbeth
MALCOLM	Will seem as pure as snow, and the poor state
MALCOLM	Esteem him as a lamb, being compar'd
MALCOLM	With my confineless harms.
MALCOLM	I grant him bloody,
MALCOLM	Luxurious, avaricious, false, deceitful,
MALCOLM	Sudden, malicious, smacking of every sin
MALCOLM	That has a name; but there's no bottom, none,
MALCOLM	In my voluptuousness: your wives, your daughters,
MALCOLM	Your matrons, and your maids, could not fill up
MALCOLM	The cistern of my lust; and my desire
MALCOLM	All continent impediments would o'erbear
MALCOLM	That did oppose my will; better Macbeth
MALCOLM	Than such an one to reign.
MALCOLM	With this there grows
MALCOLM	In my most ill-compos'd affection such
MALCOLM	A stanchless avarice that, were I king,
MALCOLM	I should cut off the nobles for their lands,
MALCOLM	Desire his jewels and this other's house;
MALCOLM	And my more-having would be as a sauce
MALCOLM	To make me hunger more, that I should forge
MALCOLM	Quarrels unjust against the good and loyal,
MALCOLM	Destroying them for wealth.
MALCOLM	But I have none: the king-becoming graces,
MALCOLM	As justice, verity, temperance, stableness,
MALCOLM	Bounty, perseverance, mercy, lowliness,
MALCOLM	Devotion, patience, courage, fortitude,
MALCOLM	I have no relish of them, but abound
MALCOLM	In the division of each several crime,
MALCOLM	Acting it many ways. Nay, had I power, I should
MALCOLM	Pour the sweet milk of concord into hell,
MALCOLM	Uproar the universal peace, confound
MALCOLM	All unity on earth.
MALCOLM	If such a one be fit to govern, speak:
MALCOLM	I am as I have spoken.
MALCOLM	Macduff, this noble passion,
MALCOLM	Child of integrity, hath from my soul
MALCOLM	Wip'd the black scruples, reconcil'd my thoughts
MALCOLM	To thy good truth and honour. Devilish Macbeth
MALCOLM	By many of these trains hath sought to win me
MALCOLM	Into his power, and modest wisdom plucks me
MALCOLM	From over-credulous haste; but God above
MALCOLM	Deal between thee and me! for even now
MALCOLM	I put myself to thy direction, and
MALCOLM	Unspeak mine own detraction, here abjure
MALCOLM	The taints and blames I laid upon myself,
MALCOLM	For strangers to my nature. I am yet
MALCOLM	Unknown to woman, never was forsworn,
MALCOLM	Scarcely have coveted what was mine own;
MALCOLM	At no time broke my faith, would not betray
MALCOLM	The devil to his fellow, and delight
MALCOLM	No less in truth than life; my first false speaking
MALCOLM	Was this upon myself. What I am truly,
MALCOLM	Is thine and my poor country's to command;
MALCOLM	Whither indeed, before thy here-approach,
MALCOLM	Old Siward, with ten thousand war-like men,
MALCOLM	Already at a point, was setting forth.
MALCOLM	Now we'll together, and the chance of goodness
MALCOLM	Be like our warranted quarrel. Why are you silent?
MALCOLM	Well; more anon. Comes the king forth, I pray you?
MALCOLM	I thank you, doctor.
MALCOLM	'Tis call'd the evil:
MALCOLM	A most miraculous work in this good king,
MALCOLM	Which often, since my here-remain in England,
MALCOLM	I have seen him do. How he solicits heaven,
MALCOLM	Himself best knows; but strangely-visited people,
MALCOLM	All swoln and ulcerous, pitiful to the eye,
MALCOLM	The mere despair of surgery, he cures;
MALCOLM	Hanging a golden stamp about their necks,
MALCOLM	Put on with holy prayers; and 'tis spoken
MALCOLM	To the succeeding royalty he leaves
MALCOLM	The healing benediction. With this strange virtue,
MALCOLM	He hath a heavenly gift of prophecy,
MALCOLM	And sundry blessings hang about his throne
MALCOLM	That speak him full of grace.
MALCOLM	My countryman; but yet I know him not.
MALCOLM	I know him now. Good God, betimes remove
MALCOLM	The means that make us strangers!
MALCOLM	What's the newest grief?
MALCOLM	Be 't their comfort,
MALCOLM	We are coming thither. Gracious England hath
MALCOLM	Lent us good Siward and ten thousand men;
MALCOLM	An older and a better soldier none
MALCOLM	That Christendom gives out.
MALCOLM	Merciful heaven!
MALCOLM	What! man; ne'er pull your hat upon your brows;
MALCOLM	Give sorrow words; the grief that does not speak
MALCOLM	Whispers the o'er-fraught heart and bids it break.
MALCOLM	Be comforted:
MALCOLM	Let's make us medicine of our great revenge,
MALCOLM	To cure this deadly grief.
MALCOLM	Dispute it like a man.
MALCOLM	Be this the whetstone of your sword: let grief
MALCOLM	Convert to anger; blunt not the heart, enrage it.
MALCOLM	This tune goes manly.
MALCOLM	Come, go we to the king; our power is ready;
MALCOLM	Our lack is nothing but our leave. Macbeth
MALCOLM	Is ripe for shaking, and the powers above
MALCOLM	Put on their instruments. Receive what cheer you may;
MALCOLM	The night is long that never finds the day.
MALCOLM	Cousins, I hope the days are near at hand
MALCOLM	That chambers will be safe.
MALCOLM	Let every soldier hew him down a bough
MALCOLM	And bear 't before him: thereby shall we shadow
MALCOLM	The numbers of our host, and make discovery
MALCOLM	Err in report of us.
MALCOLM	'Tis his main hope;
MALCOLM	For where there is advantage to be given,
MALCOLM	Both more and less have given him the revolt,
MALCOLM	And none serve with him but constrained things
MALCOLM	Whose hearts are absent too.
MALCOLM	Now near enough; your leavy screens throw down,
MALCOLM	And show like those you are. You, worthy uncle,
MALCOLM	Shall, with my cousin, your right-noble son,
MALCOLM	Lead our first battle; worthy Macduff and we
MALCOLM	Shall take upon 's what else remains to do,
MALCOLM	According to our order.
MALCOLM	We have met with foes
MALCOLM	That strike beside us.
MALCOLM	I would the friends we miss were safe arriv'd.
MALCOLM	Macduff is missing, and your noble son.
MALCOLM	He's worth more sorrow,
MALCOLM	And that I'll spend for him.
MALCOLM	We shall not spend a large expense of time
MALCOLM	Before we reckon with your several loves,
MALCOLM	And make us even with you. My thanes and kinsmen,
MALCOLM	Henceforth be earls, the first that ever Scotland
MALCOLM	In such an honour nam'd. What's more to do,
MALCOLM	Which would be planted newly with the time,
MALCOLM	As calling home our exil'd friends abroad
MALCOLM	That fled the snares of watchful tyranny;
MALCOLM	Producing forth the cruel ministers
MALCOLM	Of this dead butcher and his fiend-like queen,
MALCOLM	Who, as 'tis thought, by self and violent hands
MALCOLM	Took off her life; this, and what needful else
MALCOLM	That calls upon us, by the grace of Grace
MALCOLM	We will perform in measure, time, and place:
MALCOLM	So, thanks to all at once and to each one,
MALCOLM	Whom we invite to see us crown'd at Scone.
MERCUTIO	Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.
MERCUTIO	You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings,
MERCUTIO	And soar with them above a common bound.
MERCUTIO	And, to sink in it, should you burden love;
MERCUTIO	Too great oppression for a tender thing.
MERCUTIO	If love be rough with you, be rough with love;
MERCUTIO	Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.
MERCUTIO	Give me a case to put my visage in:
MERCUTIO	A visor for a visor! what care I,
MERCUTIO	What curious eye doth quote deformities?
MERCUTIO	Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me.
MERCUTIO	Tut! dun's the mouse, the constable's own word.
MERCUTIO	If thou art Dun, we'll draw thee from the mire,
MERCUTIO	Of—save your reverence—love, wherein thou stick'st
MERCUTIO	Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho!
MERCUTIO	I mean, sir, in delay
MERCUTIO	We waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day.
MERCUTIO	Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits
MERCUTIO	Five times in that ere once in our five wits.
MERCUTIO	Why, may one ask?
MERCUTIO	And so did I.
MERCUTIO	That dreamers often lie.
MERCUTIO	O! then, I see, Queen Mab hath been with you.
MERCUTIO	She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes
MERCUTIO	In shape no bigger than an agate-stone
MERCUTIO	On the fore-finger of an alderman,
MERCUTIO	Drawn with a team of little atomies
MERCUTIO	Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep:
MERCUTIO	Her waggon-spokes made of long spinners' legs;
MERCUTIO	The cover, of the wings of grasshoppers;
MERCUTIO	The traces, of the smallest spider's web;
MERCUTIO	The collars, of the moonshine's watery beams;
MERCUTIO	Her whip, of cricket's bone; the lash, of film;
MERCUTIO	Her waggoner, a small grey-coated gnat,
MERCUTIO	Not half so big as a round little worm
MERCUTIO	Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid;
MERCUTIO	Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut,
MERCUTIO	Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,
MERCUTIO	Time out o' mind the fairies' coach-makers.
MERCUTIO	And in this state she gallops night by night
MERCUTIO	Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;
MERCUTIO	O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on curtsies straight;
MERCUTIO	O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees;
MERCUTIO	O'er ladies' lips, who straight on kisses dream;
MERCUTIO	Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,
MERCUTIO	Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are.
MERCUTIO	Sometimes she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,
MERCUTIO	And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;
MERCUTIO	And sometimes comes she with a tithe pig's tail,
MERCUTIO	Tickling a parson's nose as a' lies asleep,
MERCUTIO	Then dreams he of another benefice;
MERCUTIO	Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,
MERCUTIO	And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,
MERCUTIO	Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish bladed,
MERCUTIO	Of healths five fathom deep; and then anon
MERCUTIO	Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes;
MERCUTIO	And, being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two,
MERCUTIO	And sleeps again. This is that very Mab
MERCUTIO	That plats the manes of horses in the night;
MERCUTIO	And bakes the elf-locks in foul sluttish hairs,
MERCUTIO	Which once untangled much misfortune bodes;
MERCUTIO	This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,
MERCUTIO	That presses them and learns them first to bear,
MERCUTIO	Making them women of good carriage:
MERCUTIO	This is she—
MERCUTIO	True, I talk of dreams,
MERCUTIO	Which are the children of an idle brain,
MERCUTIO	Begot of nothing but vain fantasy;
MERCUTIO	Which is as thin of substance as the air,
MERCUTIO	And more inconstant than the wind, who woos
MERCUTIO	Even now the frozen bosom of the north,
MERCUTIO	And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence,
MERCUTIO	Turning his face to the dew-dropping south.
MERCUTIO	He is wise;
MERCUTIO	And, on my life, hath stol'n him home to bed.
MERCUTIO	Nay, I'll conjure too.
MERCUTIO	Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover!
MERCUTIO	Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh:
MERCUTIO	Speak but one rime and I am satisfied;
MERCUTIO	Cry but 'Ay me!' couple but 'love' and 'dove;'
MERCUTIO	Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word.
MERCUTIO	One nickname for her purblind son and heir,
MERCUTIO	Young Adam Cupid, he that shot so trim
MERCUTIO	When King Cophetua lov'd the beggar-maid.
MERCUTIO	He heareth not, he stirreth not, he moveth not;
MERCUTIO	The ape is dead, and I must conjure him.
MERCUTIO	I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes,
MERCUTIO	By her high forehead, and her scarlet lip,
MERCUTIO	By her fine foot, straight leg, and quivering thigh,
MERCUTIO	And the demesnes that there adjacent lie,
MERCUTIO	That in thy likeness thou appear to us.
MERCUTIO	This cannot anger him: 'twould anger him
MERCUTIO	To raise a spirit in his mistress' circle
MERCUTIO	Of some strange nature, letting it there stand
MERCUTIO	Till she had laid it, and conjur'd it down;
MERCUTIO	That were some spite: my invocation
MERCUTIO	Is fair and honest, and in his mistress' name
MERCUTIO	I conjure only but to raise up him.
MERCUTIO	If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.
MERCUTIO	Now will he sit under a medlar tree,
MERCUTIO	And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit
MERCUTIO	As maids call medlars, when they laugh alone.
MERCUTIO	O Romeo! that she were, O! that she were
MERCUTIO	An open et cætera, thou a poperin pear.
MERCUTIO	Romeo, good night: I'll to my truckle-bed;
MERCUTIO	This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep:
MERCUTIO	Come, shall we go?
MERCUTIO	Where the devil should this Romeo be?
MERCUTIO	Came he not home to-night?
MERCUTIO	Why that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline,
MERCUTIO	Torments him so, that he will sure run mad.
MERCUTIO	A challenge, on my life.
MERCUTIO	Any man that can write may answer a letter.
MERCUTIO	Alas! poor Romeo, he is already dead; stabbed with a white wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a love-song; the very pin of his heart cleft with the blind bow-boy's butt-shaft; and is he a man to encounter Tybalt?
MERCUTIO	More than prince of cats, I can tell you. O! he is the courageous captain of compliments. He fights as you sing prick-song, keeps time, distance, and proportion; rests me his minim rest, one, two, and the third in your bosom; the very butcher of a silk button, a duellist, a duellist; a gentleman of the very first house, of the first and second cause. Ah! the immortal passado! the punto reverso! the hay!
MERCUTIO	The pox of such antick, lisping, affecting fantasticoes, these new tuners of accents!—'By Jesu, a very good blade!—a very tall man! a very good whore.'—Why, is not this a lamentable thing, grandsire, that we should be thus afflicted with these strange flies, these fashion-mongers, these pardonnez-mois, who stand so much on the new form that they cannot sit at ease on the old bench? O, their bons, their bons!
MERCUTIO	Without his roe, like a dried herring. O flesh, flesh, how art thou fishified! Now is he for the numbers that Petrarch flowed in: Laura to his lady was but a kitchen-wench; marry, she had a better love to be-rime her; Dido a dowdy; Cleopatra a gipsy; Helen and Hero hildings and harlots; Thisbe, a grey eye or so, but not to the purpose. Signior Romeo, bon jour! there's a French salutation to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit fairly last night.
MERCUTIO	The slip, sir, the slip; can you not conceive?
MERCUTIO	That's as much as to say, such a case as yours constrains a man to bow in the hams.
MERCUTIO	Thou hast most kindly hit it.
MERCUTIO	Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.
MERCUTIO	Right.
MERCUTIO	Well said; follow me this jest now till thou hast worn out the pump, that, when the single sole of it is worn, the jest may remain after the wearing sole singular.
MERCUTIO	Come between us, good Benvolio; my wit faints.
MERCUTIO	Nay, if thy wits run the wild-goose chase, I have done, for thou hast more of the wild-goose in one of thy wits than, I am sure, I have in my whole five. Was I with you there for the goose?
MERCUTIO	I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.
MERCUTIO	Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most sharp sauce.
MERCUTIO	O! here's a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an inch narrow to an ell broad.
MERCUTIO	Why, is not this better now than groaning for love? now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature: for this drivelling love is like a great natural, that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole.
MERCUTIO	Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.
MERCUTIO	O! thou art deceived; I would have made it short; for I was come to the whole depth of my tale, and meant indeed to occupy the argument no longer.
MERCUTIO	A sail, a sail!
MERCUTIO	Good Peter, to hide her face; for her fan's the fairer face.
MERCUTIO	God ye good den, fair gentlewoman.
MERCUTIO	'Tis no less, I tell you; for the bawdy hand of the dial is now upon the prick of noon.
MERCUTIO	Yea! is the worst well? very well took, i' faith; wisely, wisely.
MERCUTIO	A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! So ho!
MERCUTIO	No hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie, that is something stale and hoar ere it be spent.
MERCUTIO	An old hare hoar, and an old hare hoar,
MERCUTIO	Is very good meat in Lent:
MERCUTIO	But a hare that is hoar, is too much for a score,
MERCUTIO	When it hoars ere it be spent.
MERCUTIO	Romeo, will you come to your father's? we'll to dinner thither.
MERCUTIO	Farewell, ancient lady; farewell, Lady, lady, lady.
MERCUTIO	Thou art like one of those fellows that when he enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword upon the table and says, 'God send me no need of thee!' and by the operation of the second cup draws him on the drawer, when, indeed, there is no need.
MERCUTIO	Come, come, thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as any in Italy; and as soon moved to be moody, and as soon moody to be moved.
MERCUTIO	Nay, an there were two such, we should have none shortly, for one would kill the other. Thou! why, thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more or a hair less in his beard than thou hast. Thou wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes. What eye, but such an eye, would spy out such a quarrel? Thy head is as full of quarrels as an egg is full of meat, and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as an egg for quarrelling. Thou hast quarrelled with a man for coughing in the street, because he hath wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun. Didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing his new doublet before Easter? with another, for tying his new shoes with old riband? and yet thou wilt tutor me from quarrelling!
MERCUTIO	The fee-simple! O simple!
MERCUTIO	By my heel, I care not.
MERCUTIO	And but one word with one of us? Couple it with something; make it a word and a blow.
MERCUTIO	Could you not take some occasion without giving?
MERCUTIO	Consort! What! dost thou make us minstrels? an thou make minstrels of us, look to hear nothing but discords: here's my fiddlestick; here's that shall make you dance. 'Zounds! consort!
MERCUTIO	Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze;
MERCUTIO	I will not budge for no man's pleasure, I.
MERCUTIO	But I'll be hang'd, sir, if he wear your livery:
MERCUTIO	Marry, go before to field, he'll be your follower;
MERCUTIO	Your worship in that sense may call him 'man.'
MERCUTIO	O calm, dishonourable, vile submission!
MERCUTIO	Alla stoccata carries it away.
MERCUTIO	Tybalt, you rat-catcher, will you walk?
MERCUTIO	Good king of cats, nothing but one of your nine lives, that I mean to make bold withal, and, as you shall use me hereafter, dry-beat the rest of the eight. Will you pluck your sword out of his pilcher by the ears? make haste, lest mine be about your ears ere it be out.
MERCUTIO	Come, sir, your passado.
MERCUTIO	I am hurt.
MERCUTIO	A plague o' both your houses! I am sped.
MERCUTIO	Is he gone, and hath nothing?
MERCUTIO	Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch; marry, 'tis enough.
MERCUTIO	Where is my page? Go, villain, fetch a surgeon.
MERCUTIO	No, 'tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a church door; but 'tis enough, 'twill serve: ask for me to-morrow, and you shall find me a grave man. I am peppered, I warrant, for this world. A plague o' both your houses! 'Zounds, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a cat, to scratch a man to death! a braggart, a rogue, a villain, that fights by the book of arithmetic! Why the devil came you between us? I was hurt under your arm.
MERCUTIO	Help me into some house, Benvolio,
MERCUTIO	Or I shall faint. A plague o' both your houses!
MERCUTIO	They have made worms' meat of me: I have it,
MERCUTIO	And soundly too:—your houses!
NURSE	Now, by my maidenhead, at twelve year old,—
NURSE	I bade her come. What, lamb! what, ladybird!
NURSE	God forbid! where's this girl? what, Juliet!
NURSE	Your mother.
NURSE	Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.
NURSE	I'll lay fourteen of my teeth—
NURSE	And yet to my teen be it spoken I have but four—
NURSE	She is not fourteen. How long is it now
NURSE	To Lammas-tide?
NURSE	Even or odd, of all days in the year,
NURSE	Come Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen.
NURSE	Susan and she—God rest all Christian souls!—
NURSE	Were of an age. Well, Susan is with God;
NURSE	She was too good for me. But, as I said,
NURSE	On Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen;
NURSE	That shall she, marry; I remember it well.
NURSE	'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;
NURSE	And she was wean'd, I never shall forget it,
NURSE	Of all the days of the year, upon that day;
NURSE	For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,
NURSE	Sitting in the sun under the dove-house wall;
NURSE	My lord and you were then at Mantua.
NURSE	Nay, I do bear a brain:—but, as I said,
NURSE	When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple
NURSE	Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool!
NURSE	To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug.
NURSE	'Shake,' quoth the dove-house: 'twas no need, I trow,
NURSE	To bid me trudge:
NURSE	And since that time it is eleven years;
NURSE	For then she could stand high lone; nay, by the rood,
NURSE	She could have run and waddled all about;
NURSE	For even the day before she broke her brow:
NURSE	And then my husband—God be with his soul!
NURSE	A' was a merry man—took up the child:
NURSE	'Yea,' quoth he, 'dost thou fall upon thy face?
NURSE	Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;
NURSE	Wilt thou not, Jule?' and, by my halidom,
NURSE	The pretty wretch left crying, and said 'Ay.'
NURSE	To see now how a jest shall come about!
NURSE	I warrant, an I should live a thousand years,
NURSE	I never should forget it: 'Wilt thou not, Jule?' quoth he;
NURSE	And, pretty fool, it stinted and said 'Ay.'
NURSE	Yes, madam. Yet I cannot choose but laugh,
NURSE	To think it should leave crying, and say 'Ay.'
NURSE	And yet, I warrant, it had upon its brow
NURSE	A bump as big as a young cockerel's stone;
NURSE	A parlous knock; and it cried bitterly:
NURSE	'Yea,' quoth my husband, 'fall'st upon thy face?
NURSE	Thou wilt fall backward when thou com'st to age;
NURSE	Wilt thou not, Jule?' it stinted and said 'Ay.'
NURSE	Peace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace!
NURSE	Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed:
NURSE	An I might live to see thee married once,
NURSE	I have my wish.
NURSE	An honour! were not I thine only nurse,
NURSE	I would say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat.
NURSE	A man, young lady! lady, such a man
NURSE	As all the world—why, he's a man of wax.
NURSE	Nay, he's a flower; in faith, a very flower.
NURSE	No less! nay, bigger; women grow by men.
NURSE	Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.
NURSE	Madam, your mother craves a word with you.
NURSE	Marry, bachelor,
NURSE	Her mother is the lady of the house,
NURSE	And a good lady, and a wise, and virtuous:
NURSE	I nurs'd her daughter, that you talk'd withal;
NURSE	I tell you he that can lay hold of her
NURSE	Shall have the chinks.
NURSE	The son and heir of old Tiberio.
NURSE	Marry, that, I think, be young Petruchio.
NURSE	I know not.
NURSE	His name is Romeo, and a Montague;
NURSE	The only son of your great enemy.
NURSE	What's this, what's this?
NURSE	Anon, anon!—
NURSE	Come, let's away; the strangers are all gone.
NURSE	Madam!
NURSE	Madam!
NURSE	Peter!
NURSE	My fan, Peter.
NURSE	God ye good morrow, gentlemen.
NURSE	Is it good den?
NURSE	Out upon you! what a man are you!
NURSE	By my troth, it is well said; 'for himself to mar,' quoth a'?—Gentlemen, can any of you tell me where I may find the young Romeo?
NURSE	You say well.
NURSE	If you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with you.
NURSE	Marry, farewell! I pray you, sir, what saucy merchant was this, that was so full of his ropery?
NURSE	An a' speak anything against me, I'll take him down, an a' were lustier than he is, and twenty such Jacks; and if I cannot, I'll find those that shall. Scurvy knave! I am none of his flirt-gills; I am none of his skeins-mates.
NURSE	And thou must stand by too, and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure!
NURSE	Now, afore God, I am so vexed, that every part about me quivers. Scurvy knave! Pray you, sir, a word; and as I told you, my young lady bade me inquire you out; what she bid me say I will keep to myself; but first let me tell ye, if ye should lead her into a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross kind of behaviour, as they say: for the gentlewoman is young; and, therefore, if you should deal double with her, truly it were an ill thing to be offered to any gentlewoman, and very weak dealing.
NURSE	Good heart! and i' faith, I will tell her as much. Lord, Lord! she will be a joyful woman.
NURSE	I will tell her, sir, that you do protest; which, as I take it, is a gentlemanlike offer.
NURSE	No, truly, sir; not a penny.
NURSE	This afternoon, sir? well, she shall be there.
NURSE	Now God in heaven bless thee! Hark you, sir.
NURSE	Is your man secret? Did you ne'er hear say,
NURSE	Two may keep counsel, putting one away?
NURSE	Well, sir; my mistress is the sweetest lady—Lord, Lord!—when 'twas a little prating thing,—O! there's a nobleman in town, one Paris, that would fain lay knife aboard; but she, good soul, had as lief see a toad, a very toad, as see him. I anger her sometimes and tell her that Paris is the properer man; but, I'll warrant you, when I say so, she looks as pale as any clout in the versal world. Doth not rosemary and Romeo begin both with a letter?
NURSE	Ah! mocker; that's the dog's name. R is for the—No; I know it begins with some other letter: and she had the prettiest sententious of it, of you and rosemary, that it would do you good to hear it.
NURSE	Ay, a thousand times.
NURSE	Peter!
NURSE	Before, and apace.
NURSE	Peter, stay at the gate.
NURSE	I am aweary, give me leave awhile:
NURSE	Fie, how my bones ache! What a jaunce have I had!
NURSE	Jesu! what haste? can you not stay awhile?
NURSE	Do you not see that I am out of breath?
NURSE	Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to choose a man: Romeo! no, not he; though his face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels all men's; and for a hand, and a foot, and a body, though they be not to be talked on, yet they are past compare. He is not the flower of courtesy, but, I'll warrant him, as gentle as a lamb. Go thy ways, wench; serve God. What! have you dined at home?
NURSE	Lord! how my head aches; what a head have I!
NURSE	It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.
NURSE	My back o' t'other side; O! my back, my back!
NURSE	Beshrew your heart for sending me about,
NURSE	To catch my death with jauncing up and down.
NURSE	Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I warrant, a virtuous,—Where is your mother?
NURSE	O! God's lady dear,
NURSE	Are you so hot? Marry, come up, I trow;
NURSE	Is this the poultice for my aching bones?
NURSE	Henceforward do your messages yourself.
NURSE	Have you got leave to go to shrift to-day?
NURSE	Then hie you hence to Friar Laurence' cell,
NURSE	There stays a husband to make you a wife:
NURSE	Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks,
NURSE	They'll be in scarlet straight at any news.
NURSE	Hie you to church; I must another way,
NURSE	To fetch a ladder, by the which your love
NURSE	Must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark;
NURSE	I am the drudge and toil in your delight,
NURSE	But you shall bear the burden soon at night.
NURSE	Go; I'll to dinner: hie you to the cell.
NURSE	Ay, ay, the cords.
NURSE	Ah well-a-day! he's dead, he's dead, he's dead!
NURSE	We are undone, lady, we are undone!
NURSE	Alack the day! he's gone, he's killed, he's dead!
NURSE	Romeo can,
NURSE	Though heaven cannot. O! Romeo, Romeo;
NURSE	Who ever would have thought it? Romeo!
NURSE	I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,
NURSE	God save the mark! here on his manly breast:
NURSE	A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;
NURSE	Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub'd in blood,
NURSE	All in gore blood; I swounded at the sight.
NURSE	O Tybalt, Tybalt! the best friend I had:
NURSE	O courteous Tybalt! honest gentleman!
NURSE	That ever I should live to see thee dead!
NURSE	Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished;
NURSE	Romeo, that kill'd him, he is banished.
NURSE	It did, it did; alas the day! it did.
NURSE	There's no trust,
NURSE	No faith, no honesty in men; all naught,
NURSE	All perjur'd, all dissemblers, all forsworn.
NURSE	Ah! where's my man? give me some aqua vitæ:
NURSE	These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.
NURSE	Shame come to Romeo!
NURSE	Will you speak well of him that kill'd your cousin?
NURSE	Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse:
NURSE	Will you go to them? I will bring you thither.
NURSE	Hie to your chamber; I'll find Romeo
NURSE	To comfort you: I wot well where he is.
NURSE	Hark ye, your Romeo will be here to-night:
NURSE	I'll to him; he is hid at Laurence' cell.
NURSE	Let me come in, and you shall know my errand:
NURSE	I come from Lady Juliet.
NURSE	O holy friar! O! tell me, holy friar,
NURSE	Where is my lady's lord? where's Romeo?
NURSE	O! he is even in my mistress' case,
NURSE	Just in her case!
NURSE	Ah, sir! ah, sir! Well, death's the end of all.
NURSE	O! she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;
NURSE	And now falls on her bed; and then starts up,
NURSE	And Tybalt calls, and then on Romeo cries,
NURSE	And then down falls again.
NURSE	O Lord! I could have stay'd here all the night
NURSE	To hear good counsel: O! what learning is.
NURSE	My lord, I'll tell my lady you will come.
NURSE	Here, sir, a ring she bid me give you, sir.
NURSE	Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late.
NURSE	Madam!
NURSE	Your lady mother is coming to your chamber:
NURSE	The day is broke; be wary, look about.
NURSE	God in heaven bless her!
NURSE	You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.
NURSE	I speak no treason.
NURSE	May not one speak?
NURSE	Faith, here it is. Romeo
NURSE	Is banished; and all the world to nothing
NURSE	That he dares ne'er come back to challenge you;
NURSE	Or, if he do, it needs must be by stealth.
NURSE	Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,
NURSE	I think it best you married with the county.
NURSE	O! he's a lovely gentleman;
NURSE	Romeo's a dishclout to him: an eagle, madam,
NURSE	Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye
NURSE	As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart,
NURSE	I think you are happy in this second match,
NURSE	For it excels your first: or if it did not,
NURSE	Your first is dead; or 'twere as good he were,
NURSE	As living here and you no use of him.
NURSE	And from my soul too;
NURSE	Or else beshrew them both.
NURSE	What!
NURSE	Marry, I will; and this is wisely done.
NURSE	Ay, forsooth.
NURSE	See where she comes from shrift with merry look.
NURSE	They call for dates and quinces in the pastry.
NURSE	Go, go, you cot-quean, go;
NURSE	Get you to bed; faith, you'll be sick to-morrow
NURSE	For this night's watching.
NURSE	Mistress! what, mistress! Juliet! fast, I warrant her, she:
NURSE	Why, lamb! why, lady! fie, you slug-a-bed!
NURSE	Why, love, I say! madam! sweet-heart! why, bride!
NURSE	What! not a word? you take your pennyworths now:
NURSE	Sleep for a week; for the next night, I warrant,
NURSE	The County Paris hath set up his rest,
NURSE	That you shall rest but little. God forgive me,
NURSE	Marry, and amen, how sound is she asleep!
NURSE	I needs must wake her. Madam, madam, madam!
NURSE	Ay, let the county take you in your bed;
NURSE	He'll fright you up, i' faith. Will it not be?
NURSE	What, dress'd! and in your clothes! and down again!
NURSE	I must needs wake you. Lady! lady! lady!
NURSE	Alas! alas! Help! help! my lady's dead!
NURSE	O! well-a-day, that ever I was born.
NURSE	Some aqua-vitæ, ho! My lord! my lady!
NURSE	O lamentable day!
NURSE	Look, look! O heavy day!
NURSE	She's dead, deceas'd, she's dead; alack the day!
NURSE	O lamentable day!
NURSE	O woe! O woeful, woeful, woeful day!
NURSE	Most lamentable day, most woeful day,
NURSE	That ever, ever, I did yet behold!
NURSE	O day! O day! O day! O hateful day!
NURSE	Never was seen so black a day as this:
NURSE	O woeful day, O woeful day!
NURSE	Honest good fellows, ah! put up, put up, for, well you know, this is a pitiful case.
OPHELIA	Do you doubt that?
OPHELIA	No more but so?
OPHELIA	I shall th' effect of this good lesson keep,
OPHELIA	As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,
OPHELIA	Do not, as some ungracious pastors do,
OPHELIA	Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven,
OPHELIA	Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,
OPHELIA	Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads,
OPHELIA	And recks not his own rede.
OPHELIA	'Tis in my memory lock'd,
OPHELIA	And you yourself shall keep the key of it.
OPHELIA	So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.
OPHELIA	He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders
OPHELIA	Of his affection to me.
OPHELIA	I do not know, my lord, what I should think.
OPHELIA	My lord, he hath importun'd me with love
OPHELIA	In honourable fashion.
OPHELIA	And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,
OPHELIA	With almost all the holy vows of heaven.
OPHELIA	I shall obey, my lord.
OPHELIA	Alas! my lord, I have been so affrighted.
OPHELIA	My lord, as I was sewing in my closet,
OPHELIA	Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbrac'd;
OPHELIA	No hat upon his head; his stockings foul'd,
OPHELIA	Ungarter'd, and down-gyved to his ancle;
OPHELIA	Pale as his shirt; his knees knocking each other;
OPHELIA	And with a look so piteous in purport
OPHELIA	As if he had been loosed out of hell
OPHELIA	To speak of horrors, he comes before me.
OPHELIA	My lord, I do not know;
OPHELIA	But truly I do fear it.
OPHELIA	He took me by the wrist and held me hard,
OPHELIA	Then goes he to the length of all his arm,
OPHELIA	And, with his other hand thus o'er his brow,
OPHELIA	He falls to such perusal of my face
OPHELIA	As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so;
OPHELIA	At last, a little shaking of mine arm,
OPHELIA	And thrice his head thus waving up and down,
OPHELIA	He rais'd a sigh so piteous and profound
OPHELIA	That it did seem to shatter all his bulk
OPHELIA	And end his being. That done, he lets me go,
OPHELIA	And, with his head over his shoulder turn'd,
OPHELIA	He seem'd to find his way without his eyes;
OPHELIA	For out o' doors he went without their help,
OPHELIA	And to the last bended their light on me.
OPHELIA	No, my good lord; but, as you did command,
OPHELIA	I did repel his letters and denied
OPHELIA	His access to me.
OPHELIA	Madam, I wish it may.
OPHELIA	Good my lord,
OPHELIA	How does your honour for this many a day?
OPHELIA	My lord, I have remembrances of yours,
OPHELIA	That I have longed long to re-deliver;
OPHELIA	I pray you, now receive them.
OPHELIA	My honour'd lord, you know right well you did;
OPHELIA	And, with them, words of so sweet breath compos'd
OPHELIA	As made the things more rich: their perfume lost,
OPHELIA	Take these again; for to the noble mind
OPHELIA	Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
OPHELIA	There, my lord.
OPHELIA	My lord!
OPHELIA	What means your lordship?
OPHELIA	Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than with honesty?
OPHELIA	Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.
OPHELIA	I was the more deceived.
OPHELIA	At home, my lord.
OPHELIA	O! help him, you sweet heavens!
OPHELIA	O heavenly powers, restore him!
OPHELIA	O! what a noble mind is here o'erthrown:
OPHELIA	The courtier's, soldier's, scholar's, eye, tongue, sword;
OPHELIA	The expectancy and rose of the fair state,
OPHELIA	The glass of fashion and the mould of form,
OPHELIA	The observ'd of all observers, quite, quite down!
OPHELIA	And I, of ladies most deject and wretched,
OPHELIA	That suck'd the honey of his music vows,
OPHELIA	Now see that noble and most sovereign reason,
OPHELIA	Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh;
OPHELIA	That unmatch'd form and feature of blown youth
OPHELIA	Blasted with ecstasy: O! woe is me,
OPHELIA	To have seen what I have seen, see what I see!
OPHELIA	No, my lord.
OPHELIA	Ay, my lord.
OPHELIA	I think nothing, my lord.
OPHELIA	What is, my lord?
OPHELIA	You are merry, my lord.
OPHELIA	Ay, my lord.
OPHELIA	Nay, 'tis twice two months, my lord.
OPHELIA	What means this, my lord?
OPHELIA	Belike this show imports the argument of the play.
OPHELIA	Will he tell us what this show meant?
OPHELIA	You are naught, you are naught. I'll mark the play.
OPHELIA	'Tis brief, my lord.
OPHELIA	You are a good chorus, my lord.
OPHELIA	You are keen, my lord, you are keen.
OPHELIA	Still better, and worse.
OPHELIA	The king rises.
OPHELIA	Where is the beauteous majesty of Denmark?
OPHELIA	How should I your true love know
OPHELIA	From another one?
OPHELIA	By his cockle hat and staff,
OPHELIA	And his sandal shoon.
OPHELIA	Say you? nay, pray you, mark.
OPHELIA	He is dead and gone, lady,
OPHELIA	He is dead and gone;
OPHELIA	At his head a grass-green turf;
OPHELIA	At his heals a stone.
OPHELIA	O, ho!
OPHELIA	Pray you, mark.
OPHELIA	White his shroud as the mountain snow,—
OPHELIA	Larded with sweet flowers;
OPHELIA	Which bewept to the grave did go
OPHELIA	With true-love showers.
OPHELIA	Well, God 'ild you! They say the owl was a baker's daughter. Lord! we know what we are, but know not what we may be. God be at your table!
OPHELIA	Pray you, let's have no words of this; but when they ask you what it means, say you this:
OPHELIA	To-morrow is Saint Valentine's day,
OPHELIA	All in the morning betime,
OPHELIA	And I a maid at your window,
OPHELIA	To be your Valentine:
OPHELIA	Then up he rose, and donn'd his clothes,
OPHELIA	And dupp'd the chamber door;
OPHELIA	Let in the maid, that out a maid
OPHELIA	Never departed more.
OPHELIA	Indeed, la! without an oath, I'll make an end on 't:
OPHELIA	By Gis and by Saint Charity,
OPHELIA	Alack, and fie for shame!
OPHELIA	Young men will do't, if they come to't;
OPHELIA	By Cock they are to blame.
OPHELIA	Quoth she, before you tumbled me,
OPHELIA	You promis'd me to wed:
OPHELIA	So would I ha' done, by yonder sun,
OPHELIA	An thou hadst not come to my bed.
OPHELIA	I hope all will be well. We must be patient: but I cannot choose but weep, to think they should lay him i' the cold ground. My brother shall know of it: and so I thank you for your good counsel. Come, my coach! Good-night, ladies; good-night, sweet ladies; good-night, good-night.
OPHELIA	They bore him barefac'd on the bier;
OPHELIA	Hey non nonny, nonny, hey nonny;
OPHELIA	And in his grave rain'd many a tear;—
OPHELIA	Fare you well, my dove!
OPHELIA	You must sing, a-down a-down,
OPHELIA	And you call him a-down-a.
OPHELIA	O how the wheel becomes it! It is the false steward that stole his master's daughter.
OPHELIA	There's rosemary, that's for remembrance; brance; pray, love, remember: and there is pansies, that's for thoughts.
OPHELIA	There's fennel for you, and columbines; there's rue for you; and here's some for me; we may call it herb of grace o' Sundays. O! you must wear your rue with a difference. There's a daisy; I would give you some violets, but they withered all when my father died. They say he made a good end,—
OPHELIA	For bonny sweet Robin is all my joy.
OPHELIA	And will he not come again?
OPHELIA	And will he not come again?
OPHELIA	No, no, he is dead;
OPHELIA	Go to thy death-bed,
OPHELIA	He never will come again.
OPHELIA	His beard was as white as snow
OPHELIA	All fiaxen was his poll,
OPHELIA	He is gone, he is gone,
OPHELIA	And we cast away moan:
OPHELIA	God ha' mercy on his soul!
OPHELIA	And of all Christian souls! I pray God. God be wi' ye!
POLONIUS	He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave
POLONIUS	By laboursome petition, and at last
POLONIUS	Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent:
POLONIUS	I do beseech you, give him leave to go.
POLONIUS	Yet here, Laertes! aboard, aboard, for shame!
POLONIUS	The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,
POLONIUS	And you are stay'd for. There, my blessing with thee!
POLONIUS	And these few precepts in thy memory
POLONIUS	Look thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,
POLONIUS	Nor any unproportion'd thought his act.
POLONIUS	Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar;
POLONIUS	The friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
POLONIUS	Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel;
POLONIUS	But do not dull thy palm with entertainment
POLONIUS	Of each new-hatch'd, unfledg'd comrade. Beware
POLONIUS	Of entrance to a quarrel, but, being in,
POLONIUS	Bear 't that th' opposed may beware of thee.
POLONIUS	Give every man thine ear, but few thy voice;
POLONIUS	Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.
POLONIUS	Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,
POLONIUS	But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;
POLONIUS	For the apparel oft proclaims the man,
POLONIUS	And they in France of the best rank and station
POLONIUS	Are most select and generous, chief in that.
POLONIUS	Neither a borrower, nor a lender be;
POLONIUS	For loan oft loses both itself and friend,
POLONIUS	And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
POLONIUS	This above all: to thine own self be true,
POLONIUS	And it must follow, as the night the day,
POLONIUS	Thou canst not then be false to any man.
POLONIUS	Farewell; my blessing season this in thee!
POLONIUS	The time invites you; go, your servants tend.
POLONIUS	What is 't, Ophelia, he hath said to you?
POLONIUS	Marry, well bethought:
POLONIUS	'Tis told me, he hath very oft of late
POLONIUS	Given private time to you; and you yourself
POLONIUS	Have of your audience been most free and bounteous.
POLONIUS	If it be so,—as so 'tis put on me,
POLONIUS	And that in way of caution,—I must tell you,
POLONIUS	You do not understand yourself so clearly
POLONIUS	As it behoves my daughter and your honour.
POLONIUS	What is between you? give me up the truth.
POLONIUS	Affection! pooh! you speak like a green girl,
POLONIUS	Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.
POLONIUS	Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?
POLONIUS	Marry, I'll teach you: think yourself a baby,
POLONIUS	That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,
POLONIUS	Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly;
POLONIUS	Or,—not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,
POLONIUS	Running it thus,—you'll tender me a fool.
POLONIUS	Ay, fashion you may call it: go to, go to.
POLONIUS	Ay, springes to catch woodcocks. I do know,
POLONIUS	When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul
POLONIUS	Lends the tongue vows: these blazes, daughter,
POLONIUS	Giving more light than heat, extinct in both,
POLONIUS	Even in their promise, as it is a-making,
POLONIUS	You must not take for fire. From this time
POLONIUS	Be somewhat scanter of your maiden presence;
POLONIUS	Set your entreatments at a higher rate
POLONIUS	Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,
POLONIUS	Believe so much in him, that he is young,
POLONIUS	And with a larger tether may he walk
POLONIUS	Than may be given you: in few, Ophelia,
POLONIUS	Do not believe his vows, for they are brokers,
POLONIUS	Not of that dye which their investments show,
POLONIUS	But mere implorators of unholy suits,
POLONIUS	Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,
POLONIUS	The better to beguile. This is for all:
POLONIUS	I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth,
POLONIUS	Have you so slander any moment's leisure,
POLONIUS	As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.
POLONIUS	Look to 't, I charge you; come your ways.
POLONIUS	Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.
POLONIUS	You shall do marvellous wisely, good Reynaldo,
POLONIUS	Before you visit him, to make inquiry
POLONIUS	Of his behaviour.
POLONIUS	Marry, well said, very well said. Look you, sir,
POLONIUS	Inquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;
POLONIUS	And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,
POLONIUS	What company, at what expense; and finding
POLONIUS	By this encompassment and drift of question
POLONIUS	That they do know my son, come you more nearer
POLONIUS	Than your particular demands will touch it:
POLONIUS	Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him;
POLONIUS	As thus, 'I know his father, and his friends,
POLONIUS	And, in part, him;' do you mark this, Reynaldo?
POLONIUS	'And, in part, him; but,' you may say, 'not well:
POLONIUS	But if't be he I mean, he's very wild,
POLONIUS	Addicted so and so;' and there put on him
POLONIUS	What forgeries you please; marry, none so rank
POLONIUS	As may dishonour him; take heed of that;
POLONIUS	But, sir, such wanton, wild, and usual slips
POLONIUS	As are companions noted and most known
POLONIUS	To youth and liberty.
POLONIUS	Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,
POLONIUS	Drabbing; you may go so far.
POLONIUS	Faith, no; as you may season it in the charge.
POLONIUS	You must not put another scandal on him,
POLONIUS	That he is open to incontinency;
POLONIUS	That's not my meaning; but breathe his faults so quaintly
POLONIUS	That they may seem the taints of liberty,
POLONIUS	The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,
POLONIUS	A savageness in unreclaimed blood,
POLONIUS	Of general assault.
POLONIUS	Wherefore should you do this?
POLONIUS	Marry, sir, here's my drift;
POLONIUS	And, I believe, it is a fetch of warrant:
POLONIUS	You laying these slight sullies on my son,
POLONIUS	As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' the working,
POLONIUS	Mark you,
POLONIUS	Your party in converse, him you would sound,
POLONIUS	Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes
POLONIUS	The youth you breathe of guilty, be assur'd,
POLONIUS	He closes with you in this consequence;
POLONIUS	'Good sir,' or so; or 'friend,' or 'gentleman,'
POLONIUS	According to the phrase or the addition
POLONIUS	Of man and country.
POLONIUS	And then, sir, does he this,—he does,—what was I about to say? By the mass I was about to say something: where did I leave?
POLONIUS	At 'closes in the consequence,' ay, marry;
POLONIUS	He closes with you thus: 'I know the gentleman;
POLONIUS	I saw him yesterday, or t' other day,
POLONIUS	Or then, or then; with such, or such; and, as you say,
POLONIUS	There was a' gaming; there o'ertook in 's rouse;
POLONIUS	There falling out at tennis;' or perchance,
POLONIUS	'I saw him enter such a house of sale,'
POLONIUS	Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.
POLONIUS	See you now;
POLONIUS	Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth;
POLONIUS	And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,
POLONIUS	With windlasses, and with assays of bias,
POLONIUS	By indirections find directions out:
POLONIUS	So by my former lecture and advice
POLONIUS	Shall you my son. You have me, have you not?
POLONIUS	God be wi' you; fare you well.
POLONIUS	Observe his inclination in yourself.
POLONIUS	And let him ply his music.
POLONIUS	Farewell!
POLONIUS	How now, Ophelia! what's the matter?
POLONIUS	With what, in the name of God?
POLONIUS	Mad for thy love?
POLONIUS	What said he?
POLONIUS	Come, go with me; I will go seek the king.
POLONIUS	This is the very ecstasy of love,
POLONIUS	Whose violent property fordoes itself
POLONIUS	And leads the will to desperate undertakings
POLONIUS	As oft as any passion under heaven
POLONIUS	That does afflict our natures. I am sorry.
POLONIUS	What! have you given him any hard words of late?
POLONIUS	That hath made him mad.
POLONIUS	I am sorry that with better heed and judgment
POLONIUS	I had not quoted him; I fear'd he did but trifle,
POLONIUS	And meant to wrack thee; but, beshrew my jealousy!
POLONIUS	By heaven, it is as proper to our age
POLONIUS	To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions
POLONIUS	As it is common for the younger sort
POLONIUS	To lack discretion. Come, go we to the king:
POLONIUS	This must be known; which, being kept close, might move
POLONIUS	More grief to hide than hate to utter love.
POLONIUS	Come.
POLONIUS	The ambassadors from Norway, my good lord,
POLONIUS	Are joyfully return'd.
POLONIUS	Have I, my lord? Assure you, my good liege,
POLONIUS	I hold my duty, as I hold my soul,
POLONIUS	Both to my God and to my gracious king;
POLONIUS	And I do think—or else this brain of mine
POLONIUS	Hunts not the trail of policy so sure
POLONIUS	As it hath us'd to do—that I have found
POLONIUS	The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.
POLONIUS	Give first admittance to the ambassadors;
POLONIUS	My news shall be the fruit to that great feast.
POLONIUS	This business is well ended.
POLONIUS	My liege, and madam, to expostulate
POLONIUS	What majesty should be, what duty is,
POLONIUS	Why day is day, night night, and time is time,
POLONIUS	Were nothing but to waste night, day, and time.
POLONIUS	Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,
POLONIUS	And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,
POLONIUS	I will be brief. Your noble son is mad:
POLONIUS	Mad call I it; for, to define true madness,
POLONIUS	What is 't but to be nothing else but mad?
POLONIUS	But let that go.
POLONIUS	Madam, I swear I use no art at all.
POLONIUS	That he is mad, 'tis true; 'tis true 'tis pity;
POLONIUS	And pity 'tis 'tis true: a foolish figure;
POLONIUS	But farewell it, for I will use no art.
POLONIUS	Mad let us grant him, then; and now remains
POLONIUS	That we find out the cause of this effect,
POLONIUS	Or rather say, the cause of this defect,
POLONIUS	For this effect defective comes by cause;
POLONIUS	Thus it remains, and the remainder thus.
POLONIUS	Perpend.
POLONIUS	I have a daughter, have while she is mine;
POLONIUS	Who, in her duty and obedience, mark,
POLONIUS	Hath given me this: now, gather, and surmise.
POLONIUS	"To the celestial, and my soul's idol, the most beautified Ophelia.—"
POLONIUS	That's an ill phrase, a vile phrase; 'beautified'
POLONIUS	is a vile phrase; but you shall hear. Thus:
POLONIUS	In her excellent white bosom, these, &c.—
POLONIUS	Good madam, stay awhile; I will be faithful.
POLONIUS	"Doubt thou the stars are fire;
POLONIUS	Doubt that the sun doth move;
POLONIUS	Doubt truth to be a liar;
POLONIUS	But never doubt I love.
POLONIUS	O dear Ophelia! I am ill at these numbers: I have not art to reckon my groans; but that I love thee best, O most best! believe it. Adieu.
POLONIUS	Thine evermore, most dear lady, whilst this machine is to him,HAMLET."
POLONIUS	This in obedience hath my daughter shown me;
POLONIUS	And more above, hath his solicitings,
POLONIUS	As they fell out by time, by means, and place,
POLONIUS	All given to mine ear.
POLONIUS	What do you think of me?
POLONIUS	I would fain prove so. But what might you think,
POLONIUS	When I had seen this hot love on the wing,—
POLONIUS	As I perceiv'd it, I must tell you that,
POLONIUS	Before my daughter told me,—what might you,
POLONIUS	Or my dear majesty, your queen here, think,
POLONIUS	If I had play'd the desk or table-book,
POLONIUS	Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb,
POLONIUS	Or look'd upon this love with idle sight;
POLONIUS	What might you think? No, I went round to work,
POLONIUS	And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:
POLONIUS	'Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star;
POLONIUS	This must not be:' and then I precepts gave her,
POLONIUS	That she should lock herself from his resort,
POLONIUS	Admit no messengers, receive no tokens.
POLONIUS	Which done, she took the fruits of my advice;
POLONIUS	And he, repulsed,—a short tale to make,—
POLONIUS	Fell into a sadness, then into a fast,
POLONIUS	Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness,
POLONIUS	Thence to a lightness; and by this declension
POLONIUS	Into the madness wherein now he raves,
POLONIUS	And all we wail for.
POLONIUS	Hath there been such a time,—I'd fain know that,—
POLONIUS	That I have positively said, ''Tis so,'
POLONIUS	When it prov'd otherwise?
POLONIUS	Take this from this, if this be otherwise:
POLONIUS	If circumstances lead me, I will find
POLONIUS	Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed
POLONIUS	Within the centre.
POLONIUS	You know sometimes he walks four hours together
POLONIUS	Here in the lobby.
POLONIUS	At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him;
POLONIUS	Be you and I behind an arras then;
POLONIUS	Mark the encounter; if he love her not,
POLONIUS	And be not from his reason fallen thereon,
POLONIUS	Let me be no assistant for a state,
POLONIUS	But keep a farm, and carters.
POLONIUS	Away! I do beseech you, both away.
POLONIUS	I'll board him presently.
POLONIUS	O! give me leave.
POLONIUS	How does my good Lord Hamlet?
POLONIUS	Do you know me, my lord?
POLONIUS	Not I, my lord.
POLONIUS	Honest, my lord!
POLONIUS	That's very true, my lord.
POLONIUS	I have, my lord.
POLONIUS	How say you by that? Still harping on my daughter: yet he knew me not at first; he said I was a fishmonger: he is far gone, far gone: and truly in my youth I suffered much extremity for love; very near this. I'll speak to him again. What do you read, my lord?
POLONIUS	What is the matter, my lord?
POLONIUS	I mean the matter that you read, my lord.
POLONIUS	Though this be madness, yet there is method in 't. Will you walk out of the air, my lord?
POLONIUS	Indeed, that is out o' the air.
POLONIUS	How pregnant sometimes his replies are! a happiness that often madness hits on, which reason and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of. I will leave him, and suddenly contrive the means of meeting between him and my daughter. My honourable lord, I will most humbly take my leave of you.
POLONIUS	Fare you well, my lord.
POLONIUS	You go to seek the Lord Hamlet; there he is.
POLONIUS	Well be with you, gentlemen!
POLONIUS	My lord, I have news to tell you.
POLONIUS	The actors are come hither, my lord.
POLONIUS	Upon my honour,—
POLONIUS	The best actors in the world, either for tragedy, comedy, history, pastoral, pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral, tragical-historical, tragical-comical-historical-pastoral, scene individable, or poem unlimited: Seneca cannot be too heavy, nor Plautus too light. For the law of writ and the liberty, these are the only men.
POLONIUS	What a treasure had he, my lord?
POLONIUS	Still on my daughter.
POLONIUS	If you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter that I love passing well.
POLONIUS	What follows, then, my lord?
POLONIUS	'Fore God, my lord, well spoken; with good accent and good discretion.
POLONIUS	This is too long.
POLONIUS	That's good; 'mobled queen' is good.
POLONIUS	Look! wh'er he has not turned his colour and has tears in's eyes. Prithee, no more.
POLONIUS	My lord, I will use them according to their desert.
POLONIUS	Come, sirs.
POLONIUS	'Tis most true;
POLONIUS	And he beseech'd me to entreat your majesties
POLONIUS	To hear and see the matter.
POLONIUS	Ophelia, walk you here. Gracious, so please you,
POLONIUS	We will bestow ourselves.
POLONIUS	Read on this book;
POLONIUS	That show of such an exercise may colour
POLONIUS	Your loneliness. We are oft to blame in this,
POLONIUS	'Tis too much prov'd, that with devotion's visage
POLONIUS	And pious action we do sugar o'er
POLONIUS	The devil himself.
POLONIUS	I hear him coming; let's withdraw, my lord.
POLONIUS	It shall do well: but yet do I believe
POLONIUS	The origin and commencement of his grief
POLONIUS	Sprung from neglected love. How now, Ophelia!
POLONIUS	You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said;
POLONIUS	We heard it all. My lord, do as you please;
POLONIUS	But, if you hold it fit, after the play,
POLONIUS	Let his queen mother all alone entreat him
POLONIUS	To show his griefs: let her be round with him;
POLONIUS	And I'll be plac'd, so please you, in the ear
POLONIUS	Of all their conference. If she find him not,
POLONIUS	To England send him, or confine him where
POLONIUS	Your wisdom best shall think.
POLONIUS	And the queen too, and that presently.
POLONIUS	That did I, my lord, and was accounted a good actor.
POLONIUS	I did enact Julius Cæsar: I was killed i' the Capitol; Brutus killed me.
POLONIUS	O ho! do you mark that?
POLONIUS	Give o'er the play.
POLONIUS	My lord, the queen would speak with you, and presently.
POLONIUS	By the mass, and 'tis like a camel, indeed.
POLONIUS	It is backed like a weasel.
POLONIUS	Very like a whale.
POLONIUS	I will say so.
POLONIUS	My lord, he's going to his mother's closet:
POLONIUS	Behind the arras I'll convey myself
POLONIUS	To hear the process; I'll warrant she'll tax him home;
POLONIUS	And, as you said, and wisely was it said,
POLONIUS	'Tis meet that some more audience than a mother,
POLONIUS	Since nature makes them partial, should o'erhear
POLONIUS	The speech, of vantage. Fare you well, my liege:
POLONIUS	I'll call upon you ere you go to bed
POLONIUS	And tell you what I know.
POLONIUS	He will come straight. Look you lay home to him;
POLONIUS	Tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with,
POLONIUS	And that your Grace hath screen'd and stood between
POLONIUS	Much heat and him. I'll silence me e'en here.
POLONIUS	Pray you, be round with him.
POLONIUS	What, ho! help! help! help!
POLONIUS	O! I am slain.
QUEEN	Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,
QUEEN	And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
QUEEN	Do not for ever with thy vailed lids
QUEEN	Seek for thy noble father in the dust:
QUEEN	Thou know'st 'tis common; all that live must die,
QUEEN	Passing through nature to eternity.
QUEEN	If it be,
QUEEN	Why seems it so particular with thee?
QUEEN	Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet:
QUEEN	I pray thee, stay with us; go not to Wittenberg.
QUEEN	Good gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you;
QUEEN	And sure I am two men there are not living
QUEEN	To whom he more adheres. If it will please you
QUEEN	To show us so much gentry and good will
QUEEN	As to expend your time with us awhile,
QUEEN	For the supply and profit of our hope,
QUEEN	Your visitation shall receive such thanks
QUEEN	As fits a king's remembrance.
QUEEN	Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz;
QUEEN	And I beseech you instantly to visit
QUEEN	My too much changed son. Go, some of you,
QUEEN	And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.
QUEEN	Ay, amen!
QUEEN	I doubt it is no-other but the main;
QUEEN	His father's death, and our o'erhasty marriage.
QUEEN	More matter, with less art.
QUEEN	Came this from Hamlet to her?
QUEEN	It may be, very likely.
QUEEN	So he does indeed.
QUEEN	But look, where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.
QUEEN	Did he receive you well?
QUEEN	Did you assay him
QUEEN	To any pastime?
QUEEN	I shall obey you.
QUEEN	And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish
QUEEN	That your good beauties be the happy cause
QUEEN	Of Hamlet's wildness; so shall I hope your virtues
QUEEN	Will bring him to his wonted way again,
QUEEN	To both your honours.
QUEEN	Come hither, my good Hamlet, sit by me.
QUEEN	The lady doth protest too much, methinks.
QUEEN	How fares my lord?
QUEEN	I'll warrant you;
QUEEN	Fear me not. Withdraw, I hear him coming.
QUEEN	Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.
QUEEN	Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.
QUEEN	Why, how now, Hamlet!
QUEEN	Have you forgot me?
QUEEN	Nay then, I'll set those to you that can speak.
QUEEN	What wilt thou do? thou wilt not murder me?
QUEEN	Help, help, ho!
QUEEN	O me! what hast thou done?
QUEEN	O! what a rash and bloody deed is this!
QUEEN	As kill a king!
QUEEN	What have I done that thou dar'st wag thy tongue
QUEEN	In noise so rude against me?
QUEEN	Ay me! what act,
QUEEN	That roars so loud and thunders in the index?
QUEEN	O Hamlet! speak no more;
QUEEN	Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul;
QUEEN	And there I see such black and grained spots
QUEEN	As will not leave their tinct.
QUEEN	O! speak to me no more;
QUEEN	These words like daggers enter in mine ears;
QUEEN	No more, sweet Hamlet!
QUEEN	No more!
QUEEN	Alas! he's mad!
QUEEN	Alas! how is't with you,
QUEEN	That you do bend your eye on vacancy
QUEEN	And with the incorporal air do hold discourse?
QUEEN	Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep;
QUEEN	And, as the sleeping soldiers in the alarm,
QUEEN	Your bedded hair, like life in excrements,
QUEEN	Starts up and stands an end. O gentle son!
QUEEN	Upon the heat and flame of thy distemper
QUEEN	Sprinkle cool patience. Whereon do you look?
QUEEN	To whom do you speak this?
QUEEN	Nothing at all; yet all that is I see.
QUEEN	No, nothing but ourselves.
QUEEN	This is the very coinage of your brain:
QUEEN	This bodiless creation ecstasy
QUEEN	Is very cunning in.
QUEEN	O Hamlet! thou hast cleft my heart in twain.
QUEEN	What shall I do?
QUEEN	Be thou assur'd, if words be made of breath,
QUEEN	And breath of life, I have no life to breathe
QUEEN	What thou hast said to me.
QUEEN	Alack!
QUEEN	I had forgot: 'tis so concluded on.
QUEEN	Bestow this place on us a little while.
QUEEN	Ah! my good lord, what have I seen to-night.
QUEEN	Mad as the sea and wind, when both contend
QUEEN	Which is the mightier. In his lawless fit,
QUEEN	Behind the arras hearing something stir,
QUEEN	Whips out his rapier, cries, 'A rat! a rat!'
QUEEN	And, in his brainish apprehension, kills
QUEEN	The unseen good old man.
QUEEN	To draw apart the body he hath kill'd;
QUEEN	O'er whom his very madness, like some ore
QUEEN	Among a mineral of metals base,
QUEEN	Shows itself pure: he weeps for what is done.
QUEEN	I will not speak with her.
QUEEN	What would she have?
QUEEN	Let her come in.
QUEEN	To my sick soul, as sin's true nature is,
QUEEN	Each toy seems prologue to some great amiss:
QUEEN	So full of artless jealousy is guilt,
QUEEN	It spills itself in fearing to be spilt.
QUEEN	How now, Ophelia!
QUEEN	Alas! sweet lady, what imports this song?
QUEEN	Nay, but Ophelia,—
QUEEN	Alas! look here, my lord.
QUEEN	Alack! what noise is this?
QUEEN	How cheerfully on the false trail they cry!
QUEEN	O! this is counter, you false Danish dogs!
QUEEN	Calmly, good Laertes.
QUEEN	But not by him.
QUEEN	One woe doth tread upon another's heel,
QUEEN	So fast they follow: your sister's drown'd, Laertes.
QUEEN	There is a willow grows aslant a brook,
QUEEN	That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy com.linkedin.dagli.util.stream;
QUEEN	There with fantastic garlands did she come,
QUEEN	Of crow-flowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples,
QUEEN	That liberal shepherds give a grosser name,
QUEEN	But our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them:
QUEEN	There, on the pendent boughs her coronet weeds
QUEEN	Clambering to hang, an envious sliver broke,
QUEEN	When down her weedy trophies and herself
QUEEN	Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide,
QUEEN	And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up;
QUEEN	Which time she chanted snatches of old tunes,
QUEEN	As one incapable of her own distress,
QUEEN	Or like a creature native and indu'd
QUEEN	Unto that element; but long it could not be
QUEEN	Till that her garments, heavy with their drink,
QUEEN	Pull'd the poor wretch from her melodious lay
QUEEN	To muddy death.
QUEEN	Drown'd, drown'd.
QUEEN	Sweets to the sweet: farewell!
QUEEN	I hop'd thou shouldst have been my Hamlet's wife;
QUEEN	I thought thy bride-bed to have deck'd, sweet maid,
QUEEN	And not have strew'd thy grave.
QUEEN	Hamlet! Hamlet!
QUEEN	O my son! what theme?
QUEEN	For love of God, forbear him.
QUEEN	This is mere madness:
QUEEN	And thus a while the fit will work on him;
QUEEN	Anon, as patient as the female dove,
QUEEN	When that her golden couplets are disclos'd,
QUEEN	His silence will sit drooping.
QUEEN	He's fat, and scant of breath.
QUEEN	Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows;
QUEEN	The queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.
QUEEN	I will, my lord; I pray you, pardon me.
QUEEN	Come, let me wipe thy face.
QUEEN	No, no, the drink, the drink,—O my dear Hamlet!
QUEEN	The drink, the drink; I am poison'd.
ROMEO	Is the day so young?
ROMEO	Ay me! sad hours seem long.
ROMEO	Was that my father that went hence so fast?
ROMEO	Not having that, which having, makes them short.
ROMEO	Out—
ROMEO	Out of her favour, where I am in love.
ROMEO	Alas! that love, whose view is muffled still,
ROMEO	Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will.
ROMEO	Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?
ROMEO	Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.
ROMEO	Here's much to do with hate, but more with love:
ROMEO	Why then, O brawling love! O loving hate!
ROMEO	O any thing! of nothing first create.
ROMEO	O heavy lightness! serious vanity!
ROMEO	Mis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms!
ROMEO	Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health!
ROMEO	Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!
ROMEO	This love feel I, that feel no love in this.
ROMEO	Dost thou not laugh?
ROMEO	Good heart, at what?
ROMEO	Why, such is love's transgression.
ROMEO	Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,
ROMEO	Which thou wilt propagate to have it press'd
ROMEO	With more of thine: this love that thou hast shown
ROMEO	Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.
ROMEO	Love is a smoke rais'd with the fume of sighs;
ROMEO	Being purg'd, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;
ROMEO	Being vex'd, a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears:
ROMEO	What is it else? a madness most discreet,
ROMEO	A choking gall, and a preserving sweet.
ROMEO	Farewell, my coz.
ROMEO	Tut! I have lost myself; I am not here;
ROMEO	This is not Romeo, he's some other where.
ROMEO	What! shall I groan and tell thee?
ROMEO	Bid a sick man in sadness make his will;
ROMEO	Ah! word ill urg'd to one that is so ill.
ROMEO	In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
ROMEO	A right good mark-man! And she's fair I love.
ROMEO	Well, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit
ROMEO	With Cupid's arrow; she hath Dian's wit;
ROMEO	And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd,
ROMEO	From love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.
ROMEO	She will not stay the siege of loving terms,
ROMEO	Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes,
ROMEO	Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold:
ROMEO	O! she is rich in beauty; only poor
ROMEO	That, when she dies, with beauty dies her store.
ROMEO	She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste;
ROMEO	For beauty, starv'd with her severity,
ROMEO	Cuts beauty off from all posterity.
ROMEO	She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,
ROMEO	To merit bliss by making me despair:
ROMEO	She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow
ROMEO	Do I live dead that live to tell it now.
ROMEO	O! teach me how I should forget to think.
ROMEO	'Tis the way
ROMEO	To call hers exquisite, in question more.
ROMEO	These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows
ROMEO	Being black put us in mind they hide the fair;
ROMEO	He, that is strucken blind cannot forget
ROMEO	The precious treasure of his eyesight lost:
ROMEO	Show me a mistress that is passing fair,
ROMEO	What doth her beauty serve but as a note
ROMEO	Where I may read who pass'd that passing fair?
ROMEO	Farewell: thou canst not teach me to forget.
ROMEO	Your plantain leaf is excellent for that.
ROMEO	For your broken shin.
ROMEO	Not mad, but bound more than a madman is;
ROMEO	Shut up in prison, kept without my food,
ROMEO	Whipp'd and tormented, and—Good den, good fellow.
ROMEO	Ay, mine own fortune in my misery.
ROMEO	Ay, if I know the letters and the language.
ROMEO	Stay, fellow; I can read.
ROMEO	Signior Martino and his wife and daughters; County Anselme and his beauteous sisters; the lady widow of Vitruvio; Signior Placentio, and his lovely nieces; Mercutio and his brother Valentine; mine uncle Capulet, his wife and daughters; my fair niece Rosaline; Livia; Signior Valentio and his cousin Tybalt; Lucio and the lively Helena.
ROMEO	A fair assembly: whither should they come?
ROMEO	Whither?
ROMEO	Whose house?
ROMEO	Indeed, I should have asked you that before.
ROMEO	When the devout religion of mine eye
ROMEO	Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fires!
ROMEO	And these, who often drown'd could never die,
ROMEO	Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars!
ROMEO	One fairer than my love! the all-seeing sun
ROMEO	Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun.
ROMEO	I'll go along, no such sight to be shown,
ROMEO	But to rejoice in splendour of mine own.
ROMEO	What! shall this speech be spoke for our excuse,
ROMEO	Or shall we on without apology?
ROMEO	Give me a torch: I am not for this ambling;
ROMEO	Being but heavy, I will bear the light.
ROMEO	Not I, believe me: you have dancing shoes
ROMEO	With nimble soles; I have a soul of lead
ROMEO	So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.
ROMEO	I am too sore enpierced with his shaft
ROMEO	To soar with his light feathers; and so bound
ROMEO	I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe:
ROMEO	Under love's heavy burden do I sink.
ROMEO	Is love a tender thing? it is too rough,
ROMEO	Too rude, too boisterous; and it pricks like thorn.
ROMEO	A torch for me; let wantons, light of heart,
ROMEO	Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels,
ROMEO	For I am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase;
ROMEO	I'll be a candle holder, and look on.
ROMEO	The game was ne'er so fair, and I am done.
ROMEO	Nay, that's not so.
ROMEO	And we mean well in going to this masque;
ROMEO	But 'tis no wit to go.
ROMEO	I dream'd a dream to-night.
ROMEO	Well, what was yours?
ROMEO	In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.
ROMEO	Peace, peace! Mercutio, peace!
ROMEO	Thou talk'st of nothing.
ROMEO	I fear too early; for my mind misgives
ROMEO	Some consequence yet hanging in the stars
ROMEO	Shall bitterly begin his fearful date
ROMEO	With this night's revels, and expire the term
ROMEO	Of a despised life clos'd in my breast
ROMEO	By some vile forfeit of untimely death.
ROMEO	But he, that hath the steerage of my course,
ROMEO	Direct my sail!, On, lusty gentlemen.
ROMEO	What lady is that which doth enrich the hand
ROMEO	Of yonder knight?
ROMEO	O! she doth teach the torches to burn bright.
ROMEO	It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night
ROMEO	Like a rich jewel in an Ethiop's ear;
ROMEO	Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!
ROMEO	So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows,
ROMEO	As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows.
ROMEO	The measure done, I'll watch her place of stand,
ROMEO	And, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.
ROMEO	Did my heart love till now? forswear it, sight!
ROMEO	For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.
ROMEO	If I profane with my unworthiest hand
ROMEO	This holy shrine, the gentle sin is this;
ROMEO	My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand
ROMEO	To smooth that rough touch with a tenderkiss.
ROMEO	Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
ROMEO	O! then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do;
ROMEO	They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
ROMEO	Then move not, while my prayers' effect I take.
ROMEO	Thus from my lips, by thine, my sin is purg'd.
ROMEO	Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urg'd!
ROMEO	Give me my sin again.
ROMEO	What is her mother?
ROMEO	Is she a Capulet?
ROMEO	O dear account! my life is my foe's debt.
ROMEO	Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.
ROMEO	Can I go forward when my heart is here?
ROMEO	Turn back, dull earth, and find thy centre out.
ROMEO	He jests at scars, that never felt a wound.
ROMEO	But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks?
ROMEO	It is the east, and Juliet is the sun!
ROMEO	Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,
ROMEO	Who is already sick and pale with grief,
ROMEO	That thou her maid art far more fair than she:
ROMEO	Be not her maid, since she is envious;
ROMEO	Her vestal livery is but sick and green,
ROMEO	And none but fools do wear it; cast it off.
ROMEO	It is my lady; O! it is my love:
ROMEO	O! that she knew she were.
ROMEO	She speaks, yet she says nothing: what of that?
ROMEO	Her eye discourses; I will answer it.
ROMEO	I am too bold, 'tis not to me she speaks:
ROMEO	Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,
ROMEO	Having some business, do entreat her eyes
ROMEO	To twinkle in their spheres till they return.
ROMEO	What if her eyes were there, they in her head?
ROMEO	The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars
ROMEO	As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven
ROMEO	Would through the airy region com.linkedin.dagli.util.stream so bright
ROMEO	That birds would sing and think it were not night.
ROMEO	See! how she leans her cheek upon her hand:
ROMEO	O! that I were a glove upon that hand,
ROMEO	That I might touch that cheek.
ROMEO	She speaks:
ROMEO	O! speak again, bright angel; for thou art
ROMEO	As glorious to this night, being o'er my head,
ROMEO	As is a winged messenger of heaven
ROMEO	Unto the white-upturned wond'ring eyes
ROMEO	Of mortals, that fall back to gaze on him
ROMEO	When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds,
ROMEO	And sails upon the bosom of the air.
ROMEO	Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?
ROMEO	I take thee at thy word.
ROMEO	Call me but love, and I'll be new baptiz'd;
ROMEO	Henceforth I never will be Romeo.
ROMEO	By a name
ROMEO	I know not how to tall thee who I am:
ROMEO	My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,
ROMEO	Because it is an enemy to thee:
ROMEO	Had I it written, I would tear the word.
ROMEO	Neither, fair maid, if either thee dislike.
ROMEO	With love's light wings did I o'erperch these walls;
ROMEO	For stony limits cannot hold love out,
ROMEO	And what love can do that dares love attempt;
ROMEO	Therefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me.
ROMEO	Alack! there lies more peril in thine eye
ROMEO	Than twenty of their swords: look thou but sweet,
ROMEO	And I am proof against their enmity.
ROMEO	I have night's cloak to hide me from their eyes;
ROMEO	And but thou love me, let them find me here;
ROMEO	My life were better ended by their hate,
ROMEO	Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.
ROMEO	By Love, that first did prompt me to inquire;
ROMEO	He lent me counsel, and I lent him eyes.
ROMEO	I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far
ROMEO	As that vast shore wash'd with the furthest sea,
ROMEO	I would adventure for such merchandise.
ROMEO	Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear
ROMEO	That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops,—
ROMEO	What shall I swear by?
ROMEO	If my heart's dear love—
ROMEO	O! wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
ROMEO	The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
ROMEO	Wouldst thou withdraw it? for what purpose, love?
ROMEO	O blessed, blessed night! I am afeard,
ROMEO	Being in night, all this is but a dream,
ROMEO	Too flattering-sweet to be substantial.
ROMEO	So thrive my soul,—
ROMEO	A thousand times the worse, to want thy light.
ROMEO	Love goes toward love, as schoolboys from their books;
ROMEO	But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.
ROMEO	It is my soul that calls upon my name:
ROMEO	How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night,
ROMEO	Like softest music to attending ears!
ROMEO	My dear!
ROMEO	At the hour of nine.
ROMEO	Let me stand here till thou remember it.
ROMEO	And I'll still stay, to have thee still forget,
ROMEO	Forgetting any other home but this.
ROMEO	I would I were thy bird.
ROMEO	Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast!
ROMEO	Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest!
ROMEO	Hence will I to my ghostly father's cell,
ROMEO	His help to crave, and my dear hap to tell.
ROMEO	Good morrow, father!
ROMEO	That last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.
ROMEO	With Rosaline, my ghostly father? no;
ROMEO	I have forgot that name, and that name's woe.
ROMEO	I'll tell thee, ere thou ask it me again.
ROMEO	I have been feasting with mine enemy,
ROMEO	Where on a sudden one hath wounded me,
ROMEO	That's by me wounded: both our remedies
ROMEO	Within thy help and holy physic lies:
ROMEO	I bear no hatred, blessed man; for, lo!
ROMEO	My intercession likewise steads my foe.
ROMEO	Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set
ROMEO	On the fair daughter of rich Capulet:
ROMEO	As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine;
ROMEO	And all combin'd, save what thou must combine
ROMEO	By holy marriage: when and where and how
ROMEO	We met we woo'd and made exchange of vow,
ROMEO	I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,
ROMEO	That thou consent to marry us to-day.
ROMEO	Thou chidd'st me oft for loving Rosaline.
ROMEO	And bad'st me bury love.
ROMEO	I pray thee, chide not; she, whom I love now
ROMEO	Doth grace for grace and love for love allow;
ROMEO	The other did not so.
ROMEO	O! let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.
ROMEO	Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?
ROMEO	Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was great; and in such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy.
ROMEO	Meaning—to curtsy.
ROMEO	A most courteous exposition.
ROMEO	Pink for flower.
ROMEO	Why, then, is my pump well flowered.
ROMEO	O single-soled jest! solely singular for the singleness.
ROMEO	Switch and spurs, switch and spurs; or I'll cry a match.
ROMEO	Thou wast never with me for anything when thou wast not here for the goose.
ROMEO	Nay, good goose, bite not.
ROMEO	And is it not then well served in to a sweet goose?
ROMEO	I stretch it out for that word 'broad;' which added to the goose, proves thee far and wide a broad goose.
ROMEO	Here's goodly gear!
ROMEO	One, gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself to mar.
ROMEO	I can tell you; but young Romeo will be older when you have found him than he was when you sought him: I am the youngest of that name, for fault of a worse.
ROMEO	What hast thou found?
ROMEO	I will follow you.
ROMEO	A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk, and will speak more in a minute than he will stand to in a month.
ROMEO	Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I protest unto thee,—
ROMEO	What wilt thou tell her, nurse? thou dost not mark me.
ROMEO	Bid her devise
ROMEO	Some means to come to shrift this afternoon;
ROMEO	And there she shall at Friar Laurence' cell,
ROMEO	Be shriv'd and married. Here is for thy pains.
ROMEO	Go to; I say, you shall.
ROMEO	And stay, good nurse; behind the abbey wall:
ROMEO	Within this hour my man shall be with thee,
ROMEO	And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair;
ROMEO	Which to the high top-gallant of my joy
ROMEO	Must be my convoy in the secret night.
ROMEO	Farewell! Be trusty, and I'll quit thy pains.
ROMEO	Farewell! Commend me to thy mistress.
ROMEO	What sayst thou, my dear nurse?
ROMEO	I warrant thee my man's as true as steel.
ROMEO	Ay, nurse: what of that? both with an R.
ROMEO	Commend me to thy lady.
ROMEO	Amen, amen! but come what sorrow can,
ROMEO	It cannot countervail the exchange of joy
ROMEO	That one short minute gives me in her sight:
ROMEO	Do thou but close our hands with holy words,
ROMEO	Then love-devouring death do what he dare;
ROMEO	It is enough I may but call her mine.
ROMEO	Ah! Juliet, if the measure of thy joy
ROMEO	Be heap'd like mine, and that thy skill be more
ROMEO	To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath
ROMEO	This neighbour air, and let rich music's tongue
ROMEO	Unfold the imagin'd happiness that both
ROMEO	Receive in either by this dear encounter.
ROMEO	Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee
ROMEO	Doth much excuse the appertaining rage
ROMEO	To such a greeting; villain am I none,
ROMEO	Therefore farewell; I see thou know'st me not.
ROMEO	I do protest I never injur'd thee,
ROMEO	But love thee better than thou canst devise,
ROMEO	Till thou shalt know the reason of my love:
ROMEO	And so, good Capulet, which name I tender
ROMEO	As dearly as my own, be satisfied.
ROMEO	Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.
ROMEO	Draw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons.
ROMEO	Gentlemen, for shame, forbear this outrage!
ROMEO	Tybalt, Mercutio, the prince expressly hath
ROMEO	Forbidden bandying in Verona streets.
ROMEO	Hold, Tybalt! good Mercutio!
ROMEO	Courage, man; the hurt cannot be much.
ROMEO	I thought all for the best.
ROMEO	This gentleman, the prince's near ally,
ROMEO	My very friend, hath got his mortal hurt
ROMEO	In my behalf; my reputation stain'd
ROMEO	With Tybalt's slander, Tybalt, that an hour
ROMEO	Hath been my kinsman. O sweet Juliet!
ROMEO	Thy beauty hath made me effeminate,
ROMEO	And in my temper soften'd valour's steel!
ROMEO	This day's black fate on more days doth depend;
ROMEO	This but begins the woe others must end.
ROMEO	Alive! in triumph! and Mercutio slain!
ROMEO	Away to heaven, respective lenity,
ROMEO	And fire-ey'd fury be my conduct now!
ROMEO	Now, Tybalt, take the villain back again
ROMEO	That late thou gav'st me; for Mercutio's soul
ROMEO	Is but a little way above our heads,
ROMEO	Staying for thine to keep him company:
ROMEO	Either thou, or I, or both, must go with him.
ROMEO	This shall determine that.
ROMEO	O! I am Fortune's fool.
ROMEO	Father, what news? what is the prince's doom?
ROMEO	What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand,
ROMEO	That I yet know not?
ROMEO	What less than doomsday is the prince's doom?
ROMEO	Ha! banishment! be merciful, say 'death;'
ROMEO	For exile hath more terror in his look,
ROMEO	Much more than death: do not say 'banishment.'
ROMEO	There is no world without Verona walls,
ROMEO	But purgatory, torture, hell itself.
ROMEO	Hence banished is banish'd from the world,
ROMEO	And world's exile is death; then 'banished,'
ROMEO	Is death mis-term'd. Calling death 'banished,'
ROMEO	Thou cutt'st my head off with a golden axe,
ROMEO	And smil'st upon the stroke that murders me.
ROMEO	'Tis torture, and not mercy: heaven is here,
ROMEO	Where Juliet lives; and every cat and dog
ROMEO	And little mouse, every unworthy thing,
ROMEO	Live here in heaven and may look on her;
ROMEO	But Romeo may not: more validity,
ROMEO	More honourable state, more courtship lives
ROMEO	In carrion flies than Romeo: they may seize
ROMEO	On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand,
ROMEO	And steal immortal blessing from her lips,
ROMEO	Who, even in pure and vestal modesty,
ROMEO	Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;
ROMEO	Flies may do this, but I from this must fly:
ROMEO	They are free men, but I am banished.
ROMEO	And sayst thou yet that exile is not death?
ROMEO	Hadst thou no poison mix'd, no sharp-ground knife,
ROMEO	No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean,
ROMEO	But 'banished' to kill me? 'Banished!'
ROMEO	O friar! the damned use that word in hell;
ROMEO	Howlings attend it: how hast thou the heart,
ROMEO	Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,
ROMEO	A sin-absolver, and my friend profess'd,
ROMEO	To mangle me with that word 'banished?'
ROMEO	O! thou wilt speak again of banishment.
ROMEO	Yet 'banished!' Hang up philosophy!
ROMEO	Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,
ROMEO	Displant a town, reverse a prince's doom,
ROMEO	It helps not, it prevails not: talk no more.
ROMEO	How should they, when that wise men have no eyes?
ROMEO	Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel:
ROMEO	Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,
ROMEO	An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,
ROMEO	Doting like me, and like me banished,
ROMEO	Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,
ROMEO	And fall upon the ground, as I do now,
ROMEO	Taking the measure of an unmade grave.
ROMEO	Not I; unless the breath of heart-sick groans,
ROMEO	Mist-like, infold me from the search of eyes.
ROMEO	Nurse!
ROMEO	Spak'st thou of Juliet? how is it with her?
ROMEO	Doth she not think me an old murderer,
ROMEO	Now I have stain'd the childhood of our joy.
ROMEO	With blood remov'd but little from her own?
ROMEO	Where is she? and how doth she? and what says
ROMEO	My conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love?
ROMEO	As if that name,
ROMEO	Shot from the deadly level of a gun,
ROMEO	Did murder her; as that name's cursed hand
ROMEO	Murder'd her kinsman. O! tell me, friar, tell me,
ROMEO	In what vile part of this anatomy
ROMEO	Doth my name lodge? tell me, that I may sack
ROMEO	The hateful mansion.
ROMEO	Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.
ROMEO	How well my comfort is reviv'd by this!
ROMEO	But that a joy past joy calls out on me,
ROMEO	It were a grief so brief to part with thee:
ROMEO	Farewell.
ROMEO	It was the lark, the herald of the morn,
ROMEO	No nightingale: look, love, what envious streaks
ROMEO	Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east:
ROMEO	Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day
ROMEO	Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops:
ROMEO	I must be gone and live, or stay and die.
ROMEO	Let me be ta'en, let me be put to death;
ROMEO	I am content, so thou wilt have it so.
ROMEO	I'll say yon grey is not the morning's eye,
ROMEO	'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow;
ROMEO	Nor that is not the lark, whose notes do beat
ROMEO	The vaulty heaven so high above our heads:
ROMEO	I have more care to stay than will to go:
ROMEO	Come, death, and welcome! Juliet wills it so.
ROMEO	How is't, my soul? let's talk; it is not day.
ROMEO	More light and light; more dark and dark our woes.
ROMEO	Farewell, farewell! one kiss, and I'll descend.
ROMEO	Farewell!
ROMEO	I will omit no opportunity
ROMEO	That may convey my greetings, love, to thee.
ROMEO	I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve
ROMEO	For sweet discourses in our time to come.
ROMEO	And trust me, love, in my eye so do you:
ROMEO	Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu! adieu!
ROMEO	If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep,
ROMEO	My dreams presage some joyful news at hand:
ROMEO	My bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne;
ROMEO	And all this day an unaccustom'd spirit
ROMEO	Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.
ROMEO	I dreamt my lady came and found me dead;—
ROMEO	Strange dream, that gives a dead man leave to think,—
ROMEO	And breath'd such life with kisses in my lips,
ROMEO	That I reviv'd, and was an emperor.
ROMEO	Ah me! how sweet is love itself possess'd,
ROMEO	When but love's shadows are so rich in joy!
ROMEO	News from Verona! How now, Balthasar?
ROMEO	Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar?
ROMEO	How doth my lady? Is my father well?
ROMEO	How fares my Juliet? That I ask again;
ROMEO	For nothing can be ill if she be well.
ROMEO	Is it even so? then I defy you, stars!
ROMEO	Thou know'st my lodging: get me ink and paper,
ROMEO	And hire post-horses; I will hence to-night.
ROMEO	Tush, thou art deceiv'd;
ROMEO	Leave me, and do the thing I bid thee do.
ROMEO	Hast thou no letters to me from the friar?
ROMEO	No matter; get thee gone,
ROMEO	And hire those horses: I'll be with thee straight.
ROMEO	Well, Juliet, I will he with thee to-night.
ROMEO	Let's see for means: O mischief! thou art swift
ROMEO	To enter in the thoughts of desperate men.
ROMEO	I do remember an apothecary,
ROMEO	And hereabouts he dwells, which late I noted
ROMEO	In tatter'd weeds, with overwhelming brows,
ROMEO	Culling of simples; meagre were his looks,
ROMEO	Sharp misery had worn him to the bones:
ROMEO	And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,
ROMEO	An alligator stuff'd, and other skins
ROMEO	Of ill-shap'd fishes; and about his shelves
ROMEO	A beggarly account of empty boxes,
ROMEO	Green earthen pots, bladders, and musty seeds,
ROMEO	Remnants of packthread, and old cakes of roses,
ROMEO	Were thinly scatter'd, to make up a show.
ROMEO	Noting this penury, to myself I said
ROMEO	An if a man did need a poison now,
ROMEO	Whose sale is present death in Mantua,
ROMEO	Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.
ROMEO	O! this same thought did but fore-run my need,
ROMEO	And this same needy man must sell it me.
ROMEO	As I remember, this should be the house:
ROMEO	Being holiday, the beggar's shop is shut.
ROMEO	What, ho! apothecary!
ROMEO	Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor;
ROMEO	Hold, there is forty ducats; let me have
ROMEO	A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear
ROMEO	As will disperse itself through all the veins
ROMEO	That the life-weary taker may fall dead,
ROMEO	And that the trunk may be discharg'd of breath
ROMEO	As violently as hasty powder fir'd
ROMEO	Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb.
ROMEO	Art thou so bare, and full of wretchedness,
ROMEO	And fear'st to die? famine is in thy cheeks,
ROMEO	Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes,
ROMEO	Contempt and beggary hang upon thy back;
ROMEO	The world is not thy friend nor the world's law:
ROMEO	The world affords no law to make thee rich;
ROMEO	Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.
ROMEO	I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.
ROMEO	There is thy gold, worse poison to men's souls,
ROMEO	Doing more murders in this loathsome world
ROMEO	Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell:
ROMEO	I sell thee poison, thou hast sold me none.
ROMEO	Farewell; buy food, and get thyself in flesh.
ROMEO	Come, cordial and not poison, go with me
ROMEO	To Juliet's grave, for there must I use thee.
ROMEO	Give me that mattock, and the wrenching iron.
ROMEO	Hold, take this letter; early in the morning
ROMEO	See thou deliver it to my lord and father.
ROMEO	Give me the light: upon thy life I charge thee,
ROMEO	Whate'er thou hear'st or seest, stand all aloof,
ROMEO	And do not interrupt me in my course.
ROMEO	Why I descend into this bed of death,
ROMEO	Is partly, to behold my lady's face;
ROMEO	But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger
ROMEO	A precious ring, a ring that I must use
ROMEO	In dear employment: therefore hence, be gone:
ROMEO	But, if thou, jealous, dost return to pry
ROMEO	In what I further shall intend to do,
ROMEO	By heaven, I will tear thee joint by joint,
ROMEO	And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs.
ROMEO	The time and my intents are savage-wild,
ROMEO	More fierce and more inexorable far
ROMEO	Than empty tigers or the roaring sea.
ROMEO	So shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that:
ROMEO	Live, and be prosperous; and farewell, good fellow.
ROMEO	Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death,
ROMEO	Gorg'd with the dearest morsel of the earth,
ROMEO	Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open,
ROMEO	And, in despite, I'll cram thee with more food!
ROMEO	I must, indeed; and therefore came I hither.
ROMEO	Good gentle youth, tempt not a desperate man;
ROMEO	Fly hence and leave me: think upon these gone;
ROMEO	Let them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth,
ROMEO	Put not another sin upon my head
ROMEO	By urging me to fury: O! be gone:
ROMEO	By heaven, I love thee better than myself.
ROMEO	For I come hither arm'd against myself:
ROMEO	Stay not, be gone; live, and hereafter say
ROMEO	A madman's mercy bade thee run away.
ROMEO	Wilt thou provoke me? then have at thee, boy!
ROMEO	In faith, I will. Let me peruse this face:
ROMEO	Mercutio's kinsman, noble County Paris!
ROMEO	What said my man when my betossed soul
ROMEO	Did not attend him as we rode? I think
ROMEO	He told me Paris should have married Juliet:
ROMEO	Said he not so? or did I dream it so?
ROMEO	Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet,
ROMEO	To think it was so? O! give me thy hand,
ROMEO	One writ with me in sour misfortune's book:
ROMEO	I'll bury thee in a triumphant grave;
ROMEO	A grave? O, no! a lanthorn, slaughter'd youth,
ROMEO	For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes
ROMEO	This vault a feasting presence full of light.
ROMEO	Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr'd,
ROMEO	How oft when men are at the point of death
ROMEO	Have they been merry! which their keepers call
ROMEO	A lightning before death: O! how may I
ROMEO	Call this a lightning? O my love! my wife!
ROMEO	Death, that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath,
ROMEO	Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty:
ROMEO	Thou art not conquer'd; beauty's ensign yet
ROMEO	Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,
ROMEO	And death's pale flag is not advanced there.
ROMEO	Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?
ROMEO	O! what more favour can I do to thee,
ROMEO	Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain
ROMEO	To sunder his that was thine enemy?
ROMEO	Forgive me, cousin! Ah! dear Juliet,
ROMEO	Why art thou yet so fair? Shall I believe
ROMEO	That unsubstantial Death is amorous,
ROMEO	And that the lean abhorred monster keeps
ROMEO	Thee here in dark to be his paramour?
ROMEO	For fear of that I still will stay with thee,
ROMEO	And never from this palace of dim night
ROMEO	Depart again: here, here will I remain
ROMEO	With worms that are thy chambermaids; O! here
ROMEO	Will I set up my everlasting rest,
ROMEO	And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
ROMEO	From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!
ROMEO	Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you
ROMEO	The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss
ROMEO	A dateless bargain to engrossing death!
ROMEO	Come, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide!
ROMEO	Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on
ROMEO	The dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark!
ROMEO	Here's to my love!
ROMEO	O true apothecary!
ROMEO	Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.
ROSENCRANTZ	Both your majesties
ROSENCRANTZ	Might, by the sovereign power you have of us,
ROSENCRANTZ	Put your dread pleasures more into command
ROSENCRANTZ	Than to entreaty.
ROSENCRANTZ	God save you, sir!
ROSENCRANTZ	My most dear lord!
ROSENCRANTZ	As the indifferent children of the earth.
ROSENCRANTZ	Neither, my lord.
ROSENCRANTZ	None, my lord, but that the world's grown honest.
ROSENCRANTZ	Then is the world one.
ROSENCRANTZ	We think not so, my lord.
ROSENCRANTZ	Why, then your ambition makes it one; 'tis too narrow for your mind.
ROSENCRANTZ	Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that it is but a shadow's shadow.
ROSENCRANTZ	We'll wait upon you.
ROSENCRANTZ	To visit you, my lord; no other occasion.
ROSENCRANTZ	To what end, my lord?
ROSENCRANTZ	What say you?
ROSENCRANTZ	My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.
ROSENCRANTZ	To think, my lord; if you delight not in man, what lenten entertainment the players shall receive from you: we coted them on the way; and hither are they coming, to offer you service.
ROSENCRANTZ	Even those you were wont to take delight in, the tragedians of the city.
ROSENCRANTZ	I think their inhibition comes by the means of the late innovation.
ROSENCRANTZ	No, indeed they are not.
ROSENCRANTZ	Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace: but there is, sir, an aery of children, little eyases, that cry out on the top of question, and are most tyrannically clapped for't: these are now the fashion, and so berattle the common stages,—so they call them,—that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goose-quills, and dare scarce come thither.
ROSENCRANTZ	Faith, there has been much to-do on both sides: and the nation holds it no sin to tarre them to controversy: there was, for a while, no money bid for argument, unless the poet and the player went to cuffs in the question.
ROSENCRANTZ	Ay, that they do, my lord; Hercules and his load too.
ROSENCRANTZ	Happily he's the second time come to them; for they say an old man is twice a child.
ROSENCRANTZ	Good my lord!
ROSENCRANTZ	He does confess he feels himself distracted;
ROSENCRANTZ	But from what cause he will by no means speak.
ROSENCRANTZ	Most like a gentleman.
ROSENCRANTZ	Niggard of question, but of our demands
ROSENCRANTZ	Most free in his reply.
ROSENCRANTZ	Madam, it so fell out that certain players
ROSENCRANTZ	We o'er-raught on the way; of these we told him,
ROSENCRANTZ	And there did seem in him a kind of joy
ROSENCRANTZ	To hear of it: they are about the court,
ROSENCRANTZ	And, as I think, they have already order
ROSENCRANTZ	This night to play before him.
ROSENCRANTZ	We shall, my lord.
ROSENCRANTZ	We will, my lord.
ROSENCRANTZ	Ay, my lord; they stay upon your patience.
ROSENCRANTZ	Then, thus she says: your behaviour hath struck her into amasement and admiration.
ROSENCRANTZ	She desires to speak with you in her closet ere you go to bed.
ROSENCRANTZ	My lord, you once did love me.
ROSENCRANTZ	Good my lord, what is your cause of distemper? you do surely bar the door upon your own liberty, if you deny your griefs to your friend.
ROSENCRANTZ	How can that be when you have the voice of the king himself for your succession in Denmark?
ROSENCRANTZ	The single and peculiar life is bound
ROSENCRANTZ	With all the strength and armour of the mind
ROSENCRANTZ	To keep itself from noyance; but much more
ROSENCRANTZ	That spirit upon whose weal depend and rest
ROSENCRANTZ	The lives of many. The cease of majesty
ROSENCRANTZ	Dies not alone, but, like a gulf doth draw
ROSENCRANTZ	What's near it with it; it is a massy wheel,
ROSENCRANTZ	Fix'd on the summit of the highest mount,
ROSENCRANTZ	To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things
ROSENCRANTZ	Are mortis'd and adjoin'd; which, when it falls,
ROSENCRANTZ	Each small annexment, petty consequence,
ROSENCRANTZ	Attends the boisterous ruin. Never alone
ROSENCRANTZ	Did the king sigh, but with a general groan.
ROSENCRANTZ	We will haste us.
ROSENCRANTZ	Hamlet! Lord Hamlet!
ROSENCRANTZ	What have you done, my lord, with the dead body?
ROSENCRANTZ	Tell us where 'tis, that we may take it thence
ROSENCRANTZ	And bear it to the chapel.
ROSENCRANTZ	Believe what?
ROSENCRANTZ	Take you me for a sponge, my lord?
ROSENCRANTZ	I understand you not, my lord.
ROSENCRANTZ	My lord, you must tell us where the body is, and go with us to the king.
ROSENCRANTZ	Where the dead body is bestow'd, my lord,
ROSENCRANTZ	We cannot get from him.
ROSENCRANTZ	Without, my lord; guarded, to know your pleasure.
ROSENCRANTZ	Ho, Guildenstern! bring in my lord.
ROSENCRANTZ	Will 't please you go, my lord?
ROSS	God save the king!
ROSS	From Fife, great king;
ROSS	Where the Norweyan banners flout the sky
ROSS	And fan our people cold. Norway himself,
ROSS	With terrible numbers,
ROSS	Assisted by that most disloyal traitor,
ROSS	The Thane of Cawdor, began a dismal conflict;
ROSS	Till that Bellona's bridegroom, lapp'd in proof,
ROSS	Confronted him with self-comparisons,
ROSS	Point against point, rebellious arm 'gainst arm,
ROSS	Curbing his lavish spirit: and, to conclude,
ROSS	The victory fell on us.—
ROSS	That now
ROSS	Sweno, the Norways' king, craves composition;
ROSS	Nor would we deign him burial of his men
ROSS	Till he disbursed, at Saint Colme's Inch,
ROSS	Ten thousand dollars to our general use.
ROSS	I'll see it done.
ROSS	The king hath happily receiv'd, Macbeth,
ROSS	The news of thy success; and when he reads
ROSS	Thy personal venture in the rebels' fight,
ROSS	His wonders and his praises do contend
ROSS	Which should be thine or his. Silenc'd with that,
ROSS	In viewing o'er the rest o' the self-same day,
ROSS	He finds thee in the stout Norweyan ranks,
ROSS	Nothing afeard of what thyself didst make,
ROSS	Strange images of death. As thick as hail
ROSS	Came post with post, and every one did bear
ROSS	Thy praises in his kingdom's great defence,
ROSS	And pour'd them down before him.
ROSS	And, for an earnest of a greater honour,
ROSS	He bade me, from him, call thee Thane of Cawdor:
ROSS	In which addition, hail, most worthy thane!
ROSS	For it is thine.
ROSS	Ah! good father,
ROSS	Thou seest, the heavens, as troubled with man's act,
ROSS	Threaten his bloody stage: by the clock 'tis day,
ROSS	And yet dark night strangles the travelling lamp.
ROSS	Is 't night's predominance, or the day's shame,
ROSS	That darkness does the face of earth entomb,
ROSS	When living light should kiss it?
ROSS	And Duncan's horses,—a thing most strange and certain,—
ROSS	Beauteous and swift, the minions of their race,
ROSS	Turn'd wild in nature, broke their stalls, flung out,
ROSS	Contending 'gainst obedience, as they would
ROSS	Make war with mankind.
ROSS	They did so; to the amazement of mine eyes,
ROSS	That look'd upon 't. Here comes the good Macduff.
ROSS	How goes the world, sir, now?
ROSS	Is 't known who did this more than bloody deed?
ROSS	Alas, the day!
ROSS	What good could they pretend?
ROSS	'Gainst nature still!
ROSS	Thriftless ambition, that wilt ravin up
ROSS	Thine own life's means! Then 'tis most like
ROSS	The sovereignty will fall upon Macbeth.
ROSS	Where is Duncan's body?
ROSS	Will you to Scone?
ROSS	Well, I will thither.
ROSS	Farewell, father.
ROSS	His absence, sir,
ROSS	Lays blame upon his promise. Please 't your highness
ROSS	To grace us with your royal company.
ROSS	Gentlemen, rise; his highness is not well.
ROSS	What sights, my lord?
ROSS	You must have patience, madam.
ROSS	You know not
ROSS	Whether it was his wisdom or his fear.
ROSS	My dearest coz,
ROSS	I pray you, school yourself: but, for your husband,
ROSS	He is noble, wise, judicious, and best knows
ROSS	The fits o' the season. I dare not speak much further:
ROSS	But cruel are the times, when we are traitors
ROSS	And do not know ourselves, when we hold rumour
ROSS	From what we fear, yet know not what we fear,
ROSS	But float upon a wild and violent sea
ROSS	Each way and move. I take my leave of you:
ROSS	Shall not be long but I'll be here again.
ROSS	Things at the worst will cease, or else climb upward
ROSS	To what they were before. My pretty cousin,
ROSS	Blessing upon you!
ROSS	I am so much a fool, should I stay longer,
ROSS	It would be my disgrace, and your discomfort:
ROSS	I take my leave at once.
ROSS	Sir, amen.
ROSS	Alas! poor country;
ROSS	Almost afraid to know itself. It cannot
ROSS	Be call'd our mother, but our grave; where nothing,
ROSS	But who knows nothing, is once seen to smile;
ROSS	Where sighs and groans and shrieks that rent the air
ROSS	Are made, not mark'd; where violent sorrow seems
ROSS	A modern ecstasy; the dead man's knell
ROSS	Is there scarce ask'd for who; and good men's lives
ROSS	Expire before the flowers in their caps,
ROSS	Dying or ere they sicken.
ROSS	That of an hour's age doth hiss the speaker;
ROSS	Each minute teems a new one.
ROSS	Why, well.
ROSS	Well too.
ROSS	No; they were well at peace when I did leave 'em.
ROSS	When I came hither to transport the tidings,
ROSS	Which I have heavily borne, there ran a rumour
ROSS	Of many worthy fellows that were out;
ROSS	Which was to my belief witness'd the rather
ROSS	For that I saw the tyrant's power a-foot.
ROSS	Now is the time of help; your eye in Scotland
ROSS	Would create soldiers, make our women fight,
ROSS	To doff their dire distresses.
ROSS	Would I could answer
ROSS	This comfort with the like! But I have words
ROSS	That would be howl'd out in the desert air,
ROSS	Where hearing should not latch them.
ROSS	No mind that's honest
ROSS	But in it shares some woe, though the main part
ROSS	Pertains to you alone.
ROSS	Let not your ears despise my tongue for ever,
ROSS	Which shall possess them with the heaviest sound
ROSS	That ever yet they heard.
ROSS	Your castle is surpris'd; your wife and babes
ROSS	Savagely slaughter'd; to relate the manner,
ROSS	Were, on the quarry of these murder'd deer,
ROSS	To add the death of you.
ROSS	Wife, children, servants, all
ROSS	That could be found.
ROSS	I have said.
ROSS	Your son, my lord, has paid a soldier's debt:
ROSS	He only liv'd but till he was a man;
ROSS	The which no sooner had his prowess confirm'd
ROSS	In the unshrinking station where he fought,
ROSS	But like a man he died.
ROSS	Ay, and brought off the field. Your cause of sorrow
ROSS	Must not be measur'd by his worth, for then
ROSS	It hath no end.
ROSS	Ay, on the front.
